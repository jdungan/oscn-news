"In this case, a firefighter named Luther Gregory Cummings retired and elected to participate in the Oklahoma Firefighters Pension and Retirement Plan B program. His former spouse, Brenda Sasnett, sought to enforce their divorce decree, which awarded her 50% of Cummings' benefits from his Oklahoma Firefighter Plan A retirement. However, the decree did not specify the allocation of Plan B benefits.

     The district court ruled in favor of Sasnett, ordering Cummings to pay her a portion of the funds in his Plan B account. The Court of Civil Appeals reversed this decision, holding that the Plan B account was not marital property.

     The Oklahoma Supreme Court granted certiorari and held that when a vested firefighter elects the Plan B option after a divorce is final and the divorce decree is silent as to the award of those Plan B funds, the Plan B account is divisible marital property to the extent that any funds in the account are attributable to the marital years. Therefore, the Court of Civil Appeals' opinion was vacated and the district court's judgment was affirmed."
"The case of Jolley v. McClain, 2025 OK 6, involved a petitioner, Christopher Charles Jolley, who sought extraordinary relief from the Oklahoma Supreme Court to vacate a lower court's order quashing a subpoena duces tecum. The subpoena was directed to the Oklahoma Department of Transportation's expert property appraiser, Robert Grace, in an attempt to discover how much income he had received as an expert witness in past condemnation actions. The Supreme Court held that the issuance of a subpoena duces tecum is not among the methods prescribed by the Oklahoma Discovery Code by which an expert witness's financial information may be discovered. The Court noted that the Discovery Code permits a party to discover an expert's compensation in the instant case, as well as a list of any other cases the expert has testified for in the past four years. However, the Code does not require the expert to produce documentation on how much they were paid in those cases. The Court believed that this limit reasonably balances the litigant's need to uncover potential bias against the expert's privacy, and recognizes the diminishing returns and chilling effects of a ""shotgun"" approach to pretrial discovery. The writ of prohibition was denied."
"Following a jury verdict in favor of the plaintiffs, Rowan v. State Farm Fire & Casualty Co., they sought attorney fees and costs under Oklahoma statute 36 O.S. ยง 3629(B). The district court denied their request, finding that no evidence was presented showing that the plaintiffs had initially submitted a written proof of loss. The Oklahoma Supreme Court reversed the decision, ruling that the statute does not require a written proof of loss from the plaintiffs before they can receive attorney fees and costs. The case was remanded back to the district court for determination of the amount of attorney fees and costs."

    In the Matter of the Adoption of N.J.B., 2025 OK 8

    The Oklahoma Supreme Court reversed a lower court decision that granted an adoption without the birth mother's consent based on her failure to comply with a child support order. The mother argued the trial court erred by not considering federal stimulus payments she believed should have been credited to her child support debt.

    The Court found that the trial court abused its discretion by not considering the stimulus payments when evaluating the mother's compliance with the child support order. The Court also determined the evidence did not support a finding that the mother had willfully failed to pay child support in substantial compliance with the court order for twelve consecutive months out of the fourteen preceding the filing of the adoption petition.

    The Court remanded the case for further proceedings. (Oklahoma, January 28, 2025) OW
