The issue before the Court is whether a portion of Husband\\'s Plan B benefits, which the district court did not specifically award in the divorce decree, is marital property belonging to Wife. We hold that when a vested firefighter elects the Plan B option after a divorce is final and the divorce decree is silent as to the award of those Plan B funds, the Baggs rule applies, and the Plan B account is divisible marital property to the extent that any funds in the account are attributable to the marital years. See Baggs v. Baggs, 2016 OK 117, 385 P.3d 68.', 'FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY', \"¶2 Husband and Wife married on January 16, 1985. Husband began employment as an Oklahoma firefighter in September 1985, making him eligible for retirement in 2005. The parties remained married for almost 25 years, until April 9, 2010. The parties' divorce decree awarded Wife, among other things, 50% of Husband's benefits from his Oklahoma Firefighter Plan A retirement. Specifically, the district court awarded Wife:\", 'The decree specifically awarded Husband:', '¶3 Under the traditional Plan A retirement program, firefighters who retire from service are paid a monthly pension equal to their accrued retirement benefit. 11 O.S. Supp. 2024, § 49-106(A). A vested firefighter can also elect to enroll in Plan B, and as of that date, the monthly amount accumulated in the firefighter\\'s monthly Plan A is calculated and frozen. 11 O.S. Supp. 2023, § 49-106.1(A). The firefighter \"defers\" immediate receipt of the Plan A monthly benefit that would have been payable had the firefighter immediately ceased employment on that date. The Plan A monthly benefit amount as calculated is deposited into the Plan B account every month for five (5) years. 11 O.S. Supp. 2023, § 49-106.1(C), (D). The firefighter continues to work during this deferral period. When the firefighter ceases employment, the firefighter begins receiving (1) his or her regular monthly pension benefit (Plan A) calculated as of the date of the Plan B election, plus (2) a significant lump sum consisting of the Plan A monthly benefits deposited into the Plan B account during the deferral period, along with other contributions.', '¶4 In April 2020, Husband retired and elected to participate in the Plan B retirement program. Husband had the option of backdating his election of Plan B, with the \"back drop election date\" being Husband\\'s normal retirement date or the date five years before he elected to participate in Plan B. Husband elected to \"back drop\" on May 1, 2020, and had a \"back drop election date\" of May 1, 2015. See 11 O.S. Supp. 2023, § 49-106.1(H). When Husband elected this option, the monthly pension benefit was calculated on the earlier attained credited service and on the final average of his salary on the drop back date. Husband\\'s Plan B account was credited with an amount equal to the \"deferred benefit balance,\" which included the monthly retirement benefits that would have been payable had Husband elected to cease employment on the \"back drop election date\" and received traditional service retirement from the \"back drop election date\" to the termination date. See id.1', \"¶5 In 2021, Wife sought to enforce the divorce decree, asserting that a portion of the Plan B benefits belonged to her. The district court held an evidentiary hearing, wherein Wife presented evidence that Husband transferred approximately $118,000 owed to Wife per the decree, from Husband's Plan A account to fund his Plan B account. Wife did not claim any of the additional contributions made to the Plan B account by Husband or his employer. The district court ruled in favor of Wife, directing Husband to pay Wife the Plan A funds awarded to her in the decree, which Husband used to fund his Plan B account, plus interest, totaling $216,290.2 Husband appealed.\", \"¶6 The Court of Civil Appeals reversed and construed Wife's request as a modification to the divorce decree, holding that final property judgments cannot be modified absent fraud. We granted certiorari.\", 'STANDARD OF REVIEW', \"¶7 This case presents an issue of law in construing a divorce decree, which we review de novo. Jackson v. Jackson, 2002 OK 25, ¶ 2, 45 P.3d 418, 422. We subject the record to a plenary, independent review without regard to the trial court's reasoning or result. Gladstone v. Bartlesville Indep. Sch. Dist. No. 30, 2003 OK 30, ¶ 5, 66 P.3d 442, 446.\", 'DISCUSSION', \"A. Husband's Plan B account is divisible marital property to the extent that Husband funded the account with Plan A funds attributable to the marital years.\", \"¶8 Husband argues that Wife is not entitled to any of the Plan B funds because the district court did not specifically award these funds to Wife in their divorce decree. Husband further claims that Wife's request is an impermissible attempt to modify a final property division decree. However, Wife is not seeking to alter the property division in the decree. Wife instead seeks to compel Husband to satisfy the previously adjudicated marital property division obligation.\", '¶9 It is well settled that a property division judgment may not be modified and can only be construed if it is ambiguous on its face. Such an inquiry is confined to the judgment, and a court may not consider information beyond the judgment. Jackson, 2002 OK 25, ¶ 18, 45 P.3d at 428.', \"¶10 In looking at its plain language, the divorce decree did not contemplate a decision by Husband to participate in Plan B. The district court recognized Husband's non-election in its award of Plan A benefits to both spouses. The divorce decree specifically stated:\", 'Consequently, the district court did not award Plan B benefits to either party.3 Additionally, there is no evidence to suggest that Wife waived her right to her marital portion of Plan B funds, should that option be chosen in the future as waiver requires a voluntary and intentional relinquishment of a known right. Perry v. Perry, 1976 OK 57, ¶ 5, 551 P.2d 256, 257. Instead, the decree was silent as to the distribution of Plan B benefits if elected in the future.', \"¶11 We therefore look to the precedent set by Baggs, 2016 OK 117, 385 P.3d 68. The Baggs Court addressed the division of a retirement account where the husband had not yet chosen to retire and, therefore, had not yet selected Plan B. The Court held that the husband's Plan B benefits, should the husband choose to enroll in Plan B in the future, constituted divisible marital property to the extent any benefits deposited into the account were accumulated during the marriage:\", \"Id. ¶ 18, 385 P.3d at 76 (emphasis added). The Court explained that the Plan B retirement option is divisible marital property because when it is chosen, it is then partially funded with a portion of retirement funds that are attributable to the marital years. Id. ¶ 16, 385 P.3d at 75-76.4 Here, as in Baggs, Husband's Plan B account is composed of Plan A benefits, which the district court awarded Wife a portion of in the decree. Wife's vested interest in those retirement benefits did not lose their status upon transfer to the Plan B account.\", \"¶12 Husband argues that Baggs is inapplicable here because Wife was not entitled to Plan A benefits until Husband retired, and Husband's Plan B account was funded in the last five years before his retirement in 2021. In other words, the deposits were made post-marriage, so Wife's marital property in Plan A was not used to fund Husband's Plan B account.\", \"¶13 We disagree. The issue is not whether Wife's Plan A benefits were deposited into the Plan B account during the marriage, but rather whether the Plan B funds accrued during the marriage, regardless of when they were deposited. To illustrate, the husband in Baggs had not retired or elected to participate in Plan B at the time of the divorce. Id. ¶ 5, 385 P.3d at 70. The funds therefore were not deposited into the Plan B account during marriage. Id. ¶ 16, 385 P.3d at 76. Nevertheless, the Baggs Court taught us that in the event the Plan B option was chosen by a firefighter upon retirement, the Plan B funds were divisible to the extent that the husband deposited funds that were attributable to the marital years. Specifically, the Court said:\", 'Id. at ¶ 19, 385 P.3d at 77.', \"¶14 Here, Wife acquired a property right to Husband's Plan A retirement account once the district court entered the divorce decree. Plan B is not a separate retirement program than Plan A. Rather, it is an alternative option in the firefighters' pension program made available when Oklahoma firefighters have vested and are eligible for retirement. The pension benefits do not lose their character as vested marital benefits simply because they are moved to a new Plan B account. And Husband cannot unilaterally change the nature of the benefits, creating a new post-divorce asset that was not subject to distribution in the divorce. See, e.g., Woodard v. Woodard, 2007 OK CIV APP 61, ¶ 12, 164 P.3d 1144, 1147-48. Husband elected the Plan B program for its economic benefits and now seeks to further increase his benefits by acquiring Wife's retirement benefits deferred in the Plan B account. Husband must pay the full share of Plan A awarded to Wife, regardless of whether the retirement fund awarded to Wife existed in the same form post-decree. See, e.g., Hodge v. Hodge, 2008 OK CIV APP 96, ¶ 24, 197 P.3d 511, 515-16 (holding that the district court abused its discretion in failing to find the former husband's conversion of a portion of his retirement benefits to disability benefits impermissibly modified the consent decree by unilaterally reducing the wife's award of one-half of the husband's retirement pay from the military). We find no basis in equity or property law to allow such a conversion of Wife's marital property.\", \"¶15 The decree awarded Wife 50% of the benefits attributable to Husband's participation in the Plan A program during their marriage. At the time of Husband's retirement, the value of Wife's monthly award was $1,974,5 of the $5,600 dispersed per month from the Plan A account. Instead, Husband retired and chose to put the $5,600 monthly into a Plan B account for a five-year period. As a result, the principal amount of Wife's Plan A benefits that Husband transferred to a Plan B account for the five-year period amounted to $118,448,6 with added interest calculated by the State of Oklahoma, totaling $216,290. The district court did not err in awarding these benefits to Wife.\", \"B. Husband's election to receive Plan B benefits, resulting in a lower Plan A monthly payment, does not affect what is owed to Wife.\", '¶16 Husband contends that the district court erred by not considering that Husband received a reduction of his Plan A benefit of approximately $990 per month by choosing Plan B. Baggs addressed this issue:', 'Baggs, 2016 OK 117, ¶ 12, 385 P.3d at 73.', \"¶17 Husband's Plan A calculation was based on his salary amount at retirement, May 2020. However, Husband gave up his right to accrue additional benefits into Plan A by electing Plan B and effectively retiring in 2015. Husband understood that if he elected Plan B, he would receive less Plan A benefits per month. The tradeoff was that he would receive the economic benefit of a lump-sum payment and the receipt of his salary for five additional years. Husband's unilateral decision to receive the pension benefits by an alternative means does not change the amount of pension benefits owed to Wife under the decree--50% of the benefits attributable to Husband's participation in the Plan A program during their marriage.\", 'C. Wife is allowed to collect the interest earned on the portion of funds she owns dropped into the Plan B account.', \"¶18 Husband also argues that Wife should not be entitled to the interest earned on the Plan A funds dropped into the Plan B account. Husband contends that Wife should instead receive only the statutory interest from the date of the district court's judgment.\", '¶19 We disagree. Oklahoma law allows a member who elects to participate in Plan B to receive cost of living increases and interest. 11 O.S. Supp. 2023, § 49-106.1(E).7 It also allows an \"alternate payee,\" in this case Wife, to receive benefits payable to a member under Plan B as set forth in law, including cost of living increases and interest. 11 O.S. 2021, § 49-126(9). Wife is entitled to the Plan B pension, including the interest and any cost-of-living increases, to the extent that it is funded with retirement funds which are attributable to the marital years. Baggs, 2016 OK 117, ¶ 16, 385 P.3d at 76.', \"¶20 Each party's share in Husband's retirement benefits was dropped into the Plan B account and earned interest. Following the rationale above, Wife received a property right in Husband's retirement account that entitles her to a pro-rata share of his Plan B fund. Fifty percent of the value of Husband's pension benefits accrued during marriage, or $1,974 per month, belonged to Wife. In the same way the interest and cost of living adjustments applied to Wife's share--despite being in Husband's Plan B account--belonged to Wife. We hold that the district court did not err by awarding Wife the interest that accrued on the funds owed to her in Husband's Plan B account.8\", 'CONCLUSION', \"¶21 A portion of Husband's Plan B benefits, which the district court did not specifically award in the parties' divorce decree, is marital property belonging to Wife. When a vested firefighter elects the Plan B option after a divorce is final and the divorce decree is silent as to the award of those Plan B funds, we apply the holding in Baggs, and the Plan B account is divisible marital property to the extent that any funds in the account accrued during the marriage. Wife is also allowed to collect interest on the portion her funds placed into the Plan B account.

Husband filed a motion for new trial before the district court decided the interest award. See 12 O.S.2021, § 653. Husband never refiled his motion after the district court filed its final journal entry of judgment. Nevertheless, the district court denied the motion for new trial.', '3 The Court acknowledges that the Qualified Domestic Relations Order (\"QDRO\") contains conflicting language with the decree. It states that \"no portion of [Husband\\'s] Deferred Option (Plan B) benefits, if any, are awarded to [Wife].\" However, the language of the decree controls over the QDRO. See, e.g., Jackson, 2002 OK 25, ¶ 18, 45 P.3d at 428; Elliott v. Elliott, 2009 OK CIV APP 2, ¶ 7, 217 P.3d 147, 149. Further, Plan B benefits cannot be awarded through a QDRO if the funds are not credited to the account during marriage. 11 O.S.2021, § 49-126(9).', '4 In Baggs, the Court cited with approval several cases that recognized that once a court awarded a spouse a right to a firefighter spouse\\'s Plan A account in a decree, that judgment entitled the spouse to a pro-rata share of any Plan B funds that the former spouse would have received but for the firefighter spouse\\'s election to participate in Plan B.

Jolley sent the subpoena to the Oklahoma Department of Transportation's (ODOT) expert property appraiser in an attempt to discover how much income the appraiser has received as an expert witness in past. We assumed original jurisdiction, Okla. Const. Art. 7 § 4, and now hold that issuance of a subpoena duces tecum is not among the methods prescribed by the Oklahoma Discovery Code by which an expert witness's financial information may be discovered.\", 'ORIGINAL JURISDICTION PREVIOUSLY ASSUMED;\\nWRIT OF PROHIBITION DENIED', 'Brett Agee, Jacob Yturri, Pauls Valley, Oklahoma, for Petitioner Jolley and Real Party in Interest, Oklahoma Heritage Bank.', 'Michael W.

We hold that it is not. The Oklahoma Discovery Code prescribes the methods available to discover financial motive, as relevant to bias, on the part of expert witnesses, and a subpoena duces tecum is not among them.\", 'PROCEDURAL HISTORY', \"¶2 Real Party in Interest, the Oklahoma Department of Transportation (ODOT), attempted to acquire a strip of land owned by Petitioner, Christopher Charles Jolley (Jolley). When ODOT's efforts to purchase the property failed, it instituted a condemnation action against Jolley in the District Court of Garvin County. Consistent with Oklahoma law on such proceedings, ODOT sought the appointment of three disinterested freeholders to serve as commissioners who would appraise the property in question. See generally 69 O.S. § 1203.\", '¶3 The commissioners valued the property at $15,310.00. Jolley filed a demand for a jury trial. ODOT\\'s preliminary witness list named Robert Grace (Grace) as its expert appraiser. In November 2023, Jolley mailed a subpoena duces tecum to Grace and ODOT.1 Jolley\\'s subpoena sought the past three years\\' worth of certain financial records pertaining to Grace\\'s undertakings as an expert witness. Jolley sought all financial records, including tax forms (IRS Forms 1099), pertaining to any work Grace had done in any \"Oklahoma condemnation actions.\" Jolley also sought \"[a]ll 2021 and 2022 I.R.S. 1099 forms from any governmental entity, lawyers and/or law firms issued to any entity wholly or partly owned by Robert Grace\" -- that is, tax forms for any work Grace had performed for any government client, for any reason. ODOT moved to quash or modify the subpoena, arguing that it was outside the scope of discovery allowed by the Oklahoma Discovery Code. Jolley filed a response to the motion to quash, claiming ODOT lacked standing to object to a subpoena issued to a third party, that the subpoena was consistent with the Discovery Code, and that it was not unduly burdensome. After a hearing in January 2024, the trial court granted ODOT\\'s motion to quash. Jolley then filed the instant proceeding, seeking to compel the trial court to enforce his subpoena.', 'STANDARD OF REVIEW', '¶4 This Court may issue an extraordinary writ when a district court adjudicating a discovery dispute exceeds its authority, or issues an order that abuses its discretion. Farmers Ins. Co., Inc. v. Peterson, 2003 OK 99, ¶ 8, 81 P.3d 659, 661. An abuse of discretion occurs when a court makes an erroneous conclusion of law, or where there is no rational basis in evidence for its ruling. Christian v. Gray, 2003 OK 10, ¶¶ 43-44, 65 P.3d 591, 608-609.', 'DISCUSSION', '¶5 Our Legislature has promulgated rules on what evidence is admissible in a judicial proceeding (the Oklahoma Evidence Code), and what information is discoverable by the parties, in anticipation of a hearing or trial (the Oklahoma Discovery Code). In short, the scope of discovery is somewhat broader than the scope of admissible evidence. This allows litigants to discover information that, while perhaps not itself admissible in a court of law, could reasonably lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. See 12 O.S. § 3226(B)(1)(a) (\"Information within this scope of discovery need not be admissible in evidence to be discoverable\").', \"¶6 In a judicial proceeding, a witness's credibility may be attacked in several ways. See 12 O.S. § 2608-09. But inquiry is subject to the trial court's discretionary power to exclude even relevant evidence, if its probative value is substantially outweighed by unfair prejudice, needless repetition, or confusion of the issues. 12 O.S. § 2403. The law has long recognized that a relationship between a party and a witness may lead the witness, unconsciously or otherwise, to slant his or her testimony. Braden v. Hendricks, 1985 OK 14, ¶ 5, 695 P.2d 1343, 1348. Bias can be exposed by showing the witness's personal association with one of the parties, or a financial stake in the outcome. Id.\", \"¶7 Expert witnesses pose unique challenges. They are essential in evaluating complicated scientific, financial, or other information beyond the layman's understanding. They can advise parties throughout the litigation, and they can translate their findings and opinions to the factfinder during trial. Yet it is universally understood, even by the lay juror, that expert witnesses are usually compensated by the party that sponsors them. How much information about an expert's personal financial history is reasonably necessary to shed light on his or her potential for bias?\", \"¶8 Our Discovery Code has a specific provision regarding the discovery of financial information relevant to expert witnesses. At issue here is whether that provision is intended to be the exclusive method of obtaining such information, or merely a suggested avenue. Jolley argues that because bias is always relevant to a witness's credibility, and because an expert witness usually is paid to provide an opinion, an opposing party is entitled to see a broad swath of the expert's financial history. We believe Jolley's method, and the scope of his request, are contrary to legislative intent.\", '¶9 The General Provisions section of the Discovery Code, 12 O.S. § 3226, contains (1) descriptions of the methods used to take discovery; (2) a list of who can obtain discovery through those methods, and what type of evidence can be discovered; and (3) exceptions or limitations to these general rules. The basic methods for obtaining information from an opposing party are depositions; written interrogatories; requests for admissions; and requests for documents, mental and physical examinations, and inspection of property. 12 O.S. § 3226(A)(1). A subpoena is used to compel a person to give testimony at a deposition, permit inspection of certain tangible items, or permit inspection of premises. 12 O.S. § 3251(5).', '¶10 Section 3226(B) of the Discovery Code is entitled, \"DISCOVERY SCOPE AND LIMITS.\" The limitations to the general provisions in subsection A are broken down into general limitations for all relevant evidence, limitations on the frequency and extent of requests, what materials may be subject to privileges, and -- most pertinent here -- a specific subsection on discovery pertaining to expert witnesses. The discovery of facts known and opinions held by an expert, including bias in the formulation of those opinions, can be discovered \"only as follows\" using the means listed. 12 O.S. § 3226(B)(4)(a) (emphasis added). Through interrogatories, a party can discover (1) the expert\\'s qualifications, including any publications in the past ten years; (2) the compensation received by the expert in the instant case; and (3) a list of any other cases the expert has testified for (at trial or by deposition) in the past four years. 12 O.S. § 3226(B)(4)(a)(3). A party may also depose an opponent\\'s expert, \"subject to [the] scope of this section.\" 12 O.S. § 3226(B)(4)(a)(2) (emphasis added). And that scope limits inquiry into bias, as specifically described in (B)(4)(a)(3).', '¶11 The Discovery Code allows inquiry into how much the expert expects to make in the instant case. Jolley\\'s request included, inter alia, the production of recent IRS 1099 forms for any work Grace, or any entity wholly or partially owned by him, had performed for \"any governmental entity, lawyers and/or law firm.\" This is beyond what the Code allows. The Code permits a party to discover all other cases the expert has worked on in the past four years -- regardless of type, and regardless of what type of litigant the expert worked for. But the Code does not require the expert (or anyone else) to provide documentation on how much he or she was paid in those cases. In delineating the scope of discovery, the Code considers \"the importance of the discovery in resolving the issues, and whether the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit.\" 12 O.S. § 3226(B)(1)(a). A little research can uncover the expert\\'s compensation in past cases. But the Code places the onus for collecting that information on the party seeking it, not on the expert.2', '¶12 We stress that our holding is based on the Discovery Code\\'s proviso regarding expert witness compensation as it generally pertains to the issue of bias. Subpoenas duces tecum may certainly be appropriate where a non-party possesses financial information that is central to the issues in the case. See e.g. Royal Hot Shot Investments, Inc., v. Keeton, 2024 OK 70, __ P.3d __. But our Legislature has placed a limit on how wide a net can be cast with regard to an expert\\'s pay history. We believe this limit reasonably balances the litigant\\'s need to uncover potential bias against the expert\\'s privacy, and recognizes the diminishing returns and chilling effects of a \"shotgun\" approach to pretrial discovery.', 'ORIGINAL JURISDICTION PREVIOUSLY ASSUMED;\\nWRIT OF PROHIBITION DENIED', 'CONCUR: ROWE, C.J., KUEHN, V.C.J., and WINCHESTER, EDMONDSON,\\nCOMBS, GURICH, DARBY and KANE, JJ.', 'FOOTNOTES', '1 Subpoenas duces tecum have generally been defined as the process to cause a witness to appear at a certain time and place to give testimony, and it compels the person to produce physical evidence such as books, papers, and other documents or tangible things relevant thereto.

Comanche Nation of Okla. ex rel. Comanche Nation Tourism Ctr. v. Coffey, 2020 OK 90, ¶ 5, 480 P.3d 271, 274.\", 'Section 3629(B) does not require an insured prevailing party to have \\nfiled written proof of loss in order to receive attorney fees and costs', '¶3 Appellants based their request for attorney fees on Section 3629(B), which provides for attorney fees for a party prevailing in litigation arising from a general insurance claim:', '36 O.S. § 3629(B). Appellee does not contest that Appellants prevailed below. However, Appellee contends that, before an insured prevailing party may receive attorney fees under this statute, the insured must have initially submitted proof of loss in writing.', '¶4 Our first step is to review the plain language of the statute. We presume the Legislature intended the plain and ordinary meaning apparent from the text. Hamilton v. Northfield Insurance Co., 2020 OK 28, ¶ 10, 473 P.3d 22, 26. \"If a statute is plain and unambiguous, it will not be subjected to judicial construction, but will receive the effect its language dictates.\" Yocum v. Greenbriar Nursing Home, 2005 OK 27, ¶ 9, 130 P.3d 213, 219. Section 3629 governs what happens after an insured party has submitted a claim. Its purpose is to guarantee that, after proof of loss is submitted, insurers either reject it or offer settlement of the claim in writing within sixty days -- that is, it incentivizes prompt payment of insurance claims. Hamilton, 2020 OK 28, ¶ 14, 473 P.3d at 27.', '¶5 The statute is unambiguous. Section 3629(A) states that, if an insured party requests it in writing, the insurer must provide \"forms of proof of loss\" for the insured to complete. This requires an insurance company to give the insured party the company\\'s forms to complete to establish proof of loss if, after a claim is submitted, the insured requests the forms in writing. It neither states nor implies, as Appellee argues, that the insured\\'s claim of loss must be in \"written tangible form\", nor even that it be in written form at all. And the plain language of Section 3629(B) imposes a duty on the insurer to submit a written offer settling or rejecting a claim. It does not impose any duty on an insured to submit anything in writing.', '¶6 Appellee admits that the plain language of Section 3629 does not require insureds to submit a written proof of loss. Appellee argues that, rather than give effect to the plain language of Section 3629(B), this Court should compare it with other statutes within the Insurance Code. However, such a comparison is not necessary where the Legislature\\'s language and intent is clear. Herrera-Chacon v. State, 2023 OK 52, ¶ 7, 553 P.3d 20, 21. In addition, that comparison would not have the result Appellee intends.1 Appellee focuses on the legislation creating a standard fire insurance policy form. That form provides that an insured shall \"give immediate written notice\" of any loss. 36 O.S. § 4803(G). But the Legislature provided this form as a convenient guide, to ensure that fire insurance policies are standardized and comply with legal requirements. Their policies must meet those basic requirements, but insurance companies need not follow the form precisely; the Insurance Commissioner may approve variations from the standard form terms and conditions. 36 O.S. § 4803(F). And elsewhere the Legislature provided for time limits where a fire insurance policy \"contains a provision that the insured must render a written sworn proof of loss.\" 36 O.S. § 4805. This phrasing would be useless if every fire policy automatically required written proof. We must consider related provisions to give full force and effect to each one. Oklahoma Department of Corrections v. Byrd, 2023 OK 97, ¶ 27, 542 P.3d 845, 855. Overall, this (as well as Appellee\\'s other examples) shows that when the Legislature chooses to either suggest or require written proof of loss, it has specifically done just that. It did not do so here.', '¶7 Appellee, finally, relies wholly on Hamilton for its argument that an insured must submit proof of loss in writing. Section 3629(B) provides that an insurer must submit a rejection or settlement offer within sixty days of a claim, and that, if the claim goes to litigation and a judgment is rendered, the prevailing party shall receive costs and attorney fees, depending on whether the judgment exceeds the written offer of settlement. The issue in Hamilton was whether an insurer\\'s offer to settle pending litigation, made after the sixty-day window, should count towards the \"prevailing party\" determination. We determined it should not. There would have been no litigation had the claim been properly resolved within sixty days. Hamilton, 2020 OK 28, ¶ 11, 473 P.3d at 27. Because the statute focuses on payment of claims, not resolution of lawsuits which may arise from a denial of a claim, the determination of a prevailing party for attorney fee purposes is confined to settlement offers within the statutory sixty days. Hamilton, 2020 OK 28, ¶ 16, 473 P.3d at 28.', '¶8 The issue in Hamilton was never whether Section 3629 required written proof of loss. Appellee points to a single word in a phrase in paragraph eleven, describing the process: \"A Section 3629(B) claim directly flows from the insured\\'s written claim of loss, arising under the insurance contract and duly submitted to the insurer for payment of benefits.\" Hamilton, 2020 OK 28, ¶ 11, 473 P.2d at 27. The word \"written\" is wholly ancillary to the issue decided in Hamilton. Any incidental descriptive language the Court may have used was not intended to create a new requirement that the Legislature did not include in the statute.', 'Conclusion', \"¶9 Hamilton neither considered nor decided how an insured must submit proof of loss. However, we decide the issue now: Section 3629(B) does not require that an insured submit a written proof of loss in order to be eligible to receive attorney fees and costs. The district court's judgments denying Appellants' motion for attorney fees, and denying their motion to reconsider, are reversed. The case is remanded for the district court to determine the amount of attorney fees and costs under Section 3629.\", 'APPEAL RETAINED; TRIAL COURT REVERSED;\\nCASE REMANDED TO OKLAHOMA COUNTY DISTRICT COURT', 'CONCUR: ROWE, C.J., KUEHN, V.C.J., and WINCHESTER, EDMONDSON, and GURICH, JJ.', 'CONCUR IN RESULT: DARBY, J.', 'NOT PARTICIPATING: COMBS and KANE, JJ.', 'FOOTNOTES', '1 Appellee points us to other statutes in Insurance Code articles governing unfair claims settlements, accident and health policies, life insurance, vehicle warranties, and fire insurance. However, even this review of the overall Insurance Code does not support Appellee\\'s argument. One vehicle warranty statute implies written notice is required. 36 O.S. § 6656(A)(2) (\"proof of loss has been filed\"). However, the previous statute says merely that proof of loss must be \"filed according to the terms of the warranty\". 36 O.S. § 6655(2). One unfair claims settlement statute appears to imply a written proof is necessary -- \"properly executed proofs of loss\" -- but also refers to \"notification\" of proof of loss, which is less specific. 36 O.S. § 1250.7. And the accident and health policy statute describes standard form provisions, including one for written notice which must be included in policies, and allows insurers to vary those provisions with approval. 36 O.S. § 4405.

In August 2020, four Native American tribes (Plaintiff tribes) brought the underlying action in federal court seeking to invalidate the compacts at issue which were entered into by Governor J. Kevin Stitt and four other Native American tribes. The Plaintiff tribes each operate casinos in Oklahoma. The compacts at issue were submitted to the U.S. Secretary of the Department of the Interior for approval and were approved by operation of law. In their federal lawsuit, the Plaintiff tribes seek review and reversal of this approval. They maintain that the new compacts were not lawfully entered into by the Governor and violated Oklahoma law, and that by executing these compacts the Governor has played a role in violating their rights under the IGRA.1', '¶5 The Governor has been represented by private retained counsel since the lawsuit began, pursuant to Section 6 of Title 74, which authorizes the Governor \"to employ counsel to protect the rights or interests of the state.\" The Governor filed his first answer in January 2021, and filed an answer to the operative complaint in October 2021, in his official capacity as Governor of the State of Oklahoma and for the State of Oklahoma as the real party in interest.', '¶6 In July 2023, two and one-half years after the Governor filed his first answer, the Attorney General of Oklahoma filed a five-page Notice of Appearance in the federal case, asserting that pursuant to Section 18b(A)(3) of Title 74,2 he is authorized to \"take and assume control\" of the \"defense of the state\\'s interests.\" Notice of Appearance of Oklahoma Attorney General; Rec. at 1441. The Attorney General argued that the compacts at issue were invalid, and that the Oklahoma Supreme Court has \"clearly and unambiguously\" ruled that the Governor had no authority to unilaterally execute them. Id. at 1443 (citing Treat v. Stitt, 2020 OK 64, 473 P.3d 43 and Treat v. Stitt, 2021 OK 3, 481 P.3d 240).3 Accordingly, the Attorney General maintained that the Governor has abrogated his duty under the Oklahoma Constitution, Article VI, Section 8, to \"cause the laws of the State to be faithfully executed.\" On the same day, the Oklahoma Solicitor General also filed a Notice of Appearance in the federal case \"as attorney for J. Kevin Stitt, in his official capacity as the Governor of the State of Oklahoma, solely for the purpose of protecting the interests of the State of Oklahoma.\" Notice of Appearance; Rec. at 1451-52). There, the Solicitor General specified \"[t]o be clear, my client in this case is the real party in interest, the State of Oklahoma, not the Governor.\" Notice of Appearance; Rec. at 1451 n.1.4', '¶7 The Governor filed a motion to strike the Attorney General\\'s and Solicitor General\\'s appearances and argued that the Attorney General does not have statutory authority to replace counsel already hired by the Governor. The Governor pointed out that Oklahoma law authorizes him to \"employ counsel to protect the rights or interests of the state in any action or proceeding, civil or criminal, which has been, or is about to be commenced.\" 74 O.S. 2011, § 6. He further asserted that, because the Governor holds \"Supreme Executive power\" pursuant to the Oklahoma Constitution, Article VI, Section 2, the Attorney General does not have authority to seize the litigation from the Governor. After analyzing the issue, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia certified the above-stated question of law to this Court.', 'II. PROCEDURE AND REQUIREMENTS FOR ANSWERING CERTIFIED QUESTIONS', \"¶8 This Court is authorized to answer unresolved questions of law if certified in accordance with the Revised Uniform Certification of Questions of Law Act, 20 O.S. 2021, §§ 1601-1611. See Siloam Springs, supra, 2017 OK 14, ¶ 14, 392 P.3d at 265-66; Gov't Employees Ins. Co. v. Quine, 2011 OK 88, ¶ 13, 264 P.3d 1245, 1248. In determining whether a certified federal question of law should be answered by this Court, we consider the factors stated in 20 O.S. 2021, § 1602 -- 1) whether the answer is dispositive of an issue in pending litigation in the certifying court, and 2) whether there is established and controlling law on the subject matter. Siloam Springs, 2017 OK 14, ¶ 14, 392 P.3d at 266; Quine, 2011 OK 88, ¶ 13, 264 P.3d at 1248.\", '¶9 Both requirements in Section 1602 are satisfied here. First, answering the certified question would clearly be determinative of a pending issue in the underlying case -- whether the federal court should strike the appearance of the Attorney General. Second, the certified question presents an issue of first impression for which there is no controlling Oklahoma precedent.', 'III. ADDITIONAL BACKGROUND', '¶10 Oklahoma\\'s State-Tribal Gaming Act (the Act) provides the terms and conditions under which the State\\'s federally recognized tribes can engage in Class III gaming on tribal land through compacts. 3A O.S. Supp. 2018 §§ 261-282. The Act is \"game-specific\" and prohibits certain house-banked card, dice, and table games, as well as event wagering. 3A O.S. Supp. 2018, § 262(H). The Act also provides a Model Compact which includes fixed terms required for use in tribal gaming agreements. 3A O.S. Supp. 2018, § 280.1; 3A O.S. Supp. 2012, § 281. Procedurally, the Governor is authorized to enter into tribal gaming compacts via two methods -- 1) by using an agreement conforming with the Model Compact, or 2) if the tribal gaming compact contains provisions different from those in the Model Compact, by obtaining approval for the agreement from the Joint Committee on State-Tribal Relations (Joint Committee), as provided in Section 1221 of Title 74.5', '¶11 Under this legal framework, this Court previously declared that two of the tribal gaming compacts at issue -- those entered into between the Governor and the Comanche and Otoe-Missouria Tribes -- were invalid under Oklahoma law because the gaming compacts authorized certain forms of Class III gaming prohibited by state law. Treat v. Stitt, 2020 OK 64, ¶¶ 6-8, 473 P.3d 43, 45 [hereinafter Treat I]. While Treat I was pending before this Court, the Governor entered into two more gaming compacts with the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians (UKB) and the Kialegee Tribal Town (KTT). This Court subsequently ruled that those two compacts were also invalid under Oklahoma law because they contained terms different from the Model Compact authorized by statute and were not approved by the Joint Committee. Treat v. Stitt, 2021 OK 3, ¶ 11-12, 481 P.3d 240, 243-44 [hereinafter Treat II].', '¶12 While the Treat I and Treat II cases dealt with the compacts under Oklahoma law, the underlying case in the D.C. District Court involves the federal procedures governing the tribal gaming compacts. After a state and an Indian tribe have entered into a gaming compact, the next part of the process involves the federal IGRA, under which the compact is submitted to the Secretary of the Interior for approval. 25 U.S.C. §§ 2710(d)(3)(B), 2710(d)(8).6 If the Secretary does not approve or disapprove the compact within forty-five (45) days, the compact is considered to have been approved by the Secretary, but only to the extent it complies with the provisions of the IGRA. 25 U.S.C. § 2710(d)(8)(C). In the present case, all four compacts were submitted to the Secretary, and the Secretary took no action on any of them within the required forty-five (45) days.7 After the \"no action\" approval, the Secretary published the compacts in the Federal Register -- the Comanche and Otoe-Missouria compacts on June 29, 2020, and the UKB and KTT compacts on September 8, 2020 -- at which time the compacts \"took effect\" as a matter of federal law. 25 U.S.C. §2710(d)(3)(B).8', '¶13 The Plaintiff tribes challenge the status of the compacts under the federal law, asserting that their various defects under Oklahoma law preclude the Secretary\\'s \"no action\" approval. The Plaintiff tribes seek declaratory relief setting aside the Secretary\\'s approval of all four compacts. See First Amended and Supplemented Complaint; Rec. at 509, et seq.', \"¶14 Governor Stitt selected and retained his own counsel who has represented the Governor in defending the federal case since January 2021. In his defense, Governor Stitt has maintained that the approval of the compacts remains valid under the federal IGRA, and that any provisions which were subsequently determined to violate state law can be severed. The Governor asserts that a compact which has already taken effect under federal law cannot be rendered invalid as a result of later disputes under state law. See Memorandum of Law in Support of Defendant Governor J. Kevin Stitt's Rule 12(C) Motion, ECF # 154 and 154-1 at 18-21, Rec. at 1376-79. As these issues unfold in the underlying case, the Attorney General now seeks to appear on behalf of the Governor and the State.\", \"B. The Governor and the Attorney General Both Possess Statutory Authority Regarding Representation of the State's Interests in Litigation\", '¶15 Section 18c of Title 74 sets up Oklahoma\\'s overall approach regarding the employment of attorneys by state officers, boards, and commissions. Under this statute, state entities are generally prohibited from employing or appointing attorneys, and instead the duties of legal representation are vested in the Attorney General. The statute, however, also provides several exceptions to this general pronouncement, and it specifically authorizes the Governor \"to employ special counsel to protect the rights or interest of the state.\" 74 O.S. Supp. 2019, § 18c(A)(4)(a). The pertinent parts of Section 18c are as follows:', '¶16 Section 6 of Title 74, which is referenced in Section 18c(4)(a), specifies that the Governor has the power to retain independent legal counsel in cases involving interests of the State, and to direct the activities of his employed counsel. Section 6 states as follows:', '74 O.S. 2011, § 6 (emphasis added).', \"¶17 The statutory scheme regarding the Attorney General's authority is further laid out in Title 74, Section 18b, which designates the Attorney General as the chief law officer for the State of Oklahoma and enumerates the many duties of that office. With regard to the Attorney General's representation of the State in legal proceedings, the pertinent portions of Section 18b are as follows:\", '¶18 Relying largely upon Section 18b, the Attorney General asserts that he has broad authority to assume control of the State\\'s defense in any litigation involving the State\\'s interests. The Governor, however, points to the specific sections which provide him with the clear \"authority to employ counsel to protect the rights or interest of the state\" and to direct his chosen counsel how to proceed in that litigation. 74 O.S. Supp. 2019, § 18c(A)(4)(a); 74 O.S. 2021, § 6. After considering the arguments of both sides, the federal court determined that the State\\'s statutory scheme alone provides no established and controlling law which resolves this dispute. Memorandum Opinion and Order; Rec. at 1521.', 'C. The Constitution Vests the Governor with Supreme Executive Power', '¶19 Article VI, Section 1 of the Oklahoma Constitution enumerates the executive branch offices of the State. It provides:', 'Okla. Const. art. VI, § 1(A) (emphasis added).', '¶20 The Constitution makes no further reference to the duties or powers of the Attorney General. With regard to the Governor, however, the Constitution states that \"[t]he Supreme Executive power shall be vested in a Chief Magistrate, who shall be styled \\'The Governor of the State of Oklahoma.\\'\" Okla. Const. art. VI, § 2 (emphasis added). Section 8 of Article VI further provides that \"[t]he Governor shall cause the laws of the State to be faithfully executed, and shall conduct in person or in such manner as may be prescribed by law, all intercourse and business of the State with other states and with the United States, and he shall be a conservator of the peace throughout the State.\" Okla. Const. art. VI, § 8.', '¶21 The Governor maintains that the Attorney General\\'s attempt to take and assume control of the underlying case is incompatible with the Oklahoma Constitution. He points out that the Oklahoma Constitution does not enshrine any express powers of the Attorney General, and argues that the Attorney General\\'s authority is constitutionally inferior to the Governor\\'s. The Governor asserts that the Attorney General does not have superior powers in litigation involving the interests of the State, as such powers would interfere with the Governor\\'s exercise of his \"Supreme Executive power\" as \"Chief Magistrate\" and his constitutional prerogative cannot be unwound or preempted by another executive officer.', \"¶22 In analyzing the Governor's argument, the federal court stated:\", 'IV. ANALYSIS', 'D. The Attorney General Cannot Seize Control of the Federal Case Over the Objection of the Governor', \"¶23 At the outset, we acknowledge the gravity of the question presented for resolution by this Court and its obvious impact upon the highest offices in the executive branch of our state government. We endeavor here to answer this certified question in a manner specific to the present case, without broad pronouncements. We desire to provide an answer which will guide these two officials to perform their duties in a manner that minimizes unnecessary disruption and best supports the ongoing function of our government. With this in mind, we hold that the Governor may continue to use his chosen counsel to represent the State's interests in the present case.\", '¶24 While the Oklahoma Constitution does not explicitly describe the Governor\\'s authority over the other executive branch offices, we believe that a hierarchy is clearly contemplated by the above-quoted language in Article VI, Section 2. Black\\'s Law Dictionary defines \"magistrate\" as the \"highest-ranking official in a government, such as the king in a monarchy, the president in a republic, or the governor in a state. -- Also termed chief magistrate; first magistrate.\" Black\\'s Law Dictionary (12th ed. 2024) (emphasis in original). The common definition of \"supreme\" is \"highest in rank or authority (the supreme commander), especially: in a position of unquestioned authority, dominance, or influence.\" Merriam-Webster, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ supreme (last visited July 31, 2024) (emphasis in original). This Court has held that the use of the word \"supreme\" to modify the term \"executive power\" indicates that the people intended to vest the Governor with the full range of executive powers which were recognized when the Oklahoma Constitution was adopted. Vandelay Ent., LLC v. Fallin, 2014 OK 109, ¶ 12, 343 P.3d 1273, 1276.', '¶25 Long ago, the Kansas Supreme Court provided the following analysis regarding the \"supreme executive power\" of the Governor:', '¶26 Relevant to our analysis here, the Alabama Supreme Court recently faced a similar issue in Riley v. Cornerstone Community Outreach, Inc., 57 So. 3d 704 (Ala. 2010). In Riley, the Alabama governor had established a task force on illegal gambling and appointed special prosecutors to enforce the state gambling laws. The underlying controversy involved the state\\'s seizure and forfeiture action against certain electronic bingo gambling devices which had been confiscated. The Alabama attorney general eventually sought to assume direction and control of the ongoing action, discharge the governor\\'s appointed special counsel, and dismiss the case. The Riley court rejected the attorney general\\'s attempt to assume control, and held that the special prosecutors authorized by the governor \"have the right to represent the State in this case and to see it through to completion.\" Riley at 741.', '¶27 Alabama\\'s constitution contains pertinent language very similar to Oklahoma\\'s -- providing that the \"supreme executive power\" of the state \"shall be vested in a chief magistrate,\" who holds the power to take care that the laws are faithfully executed. Ala. Const. art. V, §§ 113, 120. After a detailed analysis regarding the positions and responsibilities of the governor and the attorney general, the Riley court stated:', \"¶28 In his concurring opinion in Riley, Alabama's Chief Justice provided a succinct summary:\", \"¶29 This Court long ago determined that the Governor's authority to bring suit in the name of the State was based upon constitutional grounds, rather than statute:\", \"¶30 The seemingly broad statutory power granted to the Attorney General to direct and control litigation does not operate to override the Governor's constitutional role as Chief Magistrate or his authority to bring suit. Although both the Governor and the Attorney General possess similar authority, the Governor is ultimately the leader of the executive branch. Under the hierarchy contemplated in the Oklahoma Constitution, the Governor has the right to represent the State's interests in the present case.\", '¶31 In addition to the constitutional considerations, we turn to the basic rules of statutory construction to reconcile the relevant statutes. This Court has long emphasized the importance of construing a statute consistent with the legislative intent, in a manner that considers the general scope and meaning of the entire act. We have stated:', '¶32 In his quest to enter an appearance in the federal case, the Attorney General argues that, under Title 74, Section 18b, he has complete dominion over litigation involving the State, and although the Governor is authorized to employ counsel, the Attorney General has the power to take and assume control in any case involving the State\\'s interests. We do not, however, read the Attorney General\\'s statutory authority to extend so broadly. Although the Attorney General is given extensive authority to represent the State, he does not possess \"complete dominion\" over all litigation involving the State or state offices. Oklahoma\\'s statutory scheme clearly contemplates that many state entities, including the office of the Governor, will retain their own counsel and direct the strategy in such representation.9 To properly ascertain legislative intent here, we must consider these statutory provisions in their entirety and to be reasonable and consistent as a whole.', '¶33 While the final portion of Section 18b(A)(3) gives the Attorney General the power to \"take and assume control\" of litigation in which he appears, we see no indication in these provisions which would subordinate the Governor\\'s express power to select his own counsel to that of the Attorney General. To the contrary, the Governor\\'s authority to select and retain his own counsel is specifically expressed by two unambiguous statutes. 74 O.S. Supp. 2019, § 18c(A)(4)(a) and 74 O.S. 2011, § 6. Although there appears to be a conflict between these statutes and Section 18b, it is not an irreconcilable one. Our prior holdings require that \"when there is a conflict between two statutes, one specific . . . and one general, the statute enacted for the purpose of dealing with the subject matter controls over the general statute.\" Stitt v. Treat, 2024 OK 21, ¶ 30, 546 P.3d 882, 893 (citing Mutual Injury Trust Fund v. Coburn, 2016 OK 120, ¶ 23, 386 P.3d 628, 636). Moreover, we will construe legislation \"in such manner as to reconcile the different provisions, render them consistent and harmonious, and give intelligent effect to each.\" South Tulsa Citizens Coalition, L.L.C. v. Arkansas River Bridge Auth., 2008 OK 4, ¶ 15, 176 P.3d 1217, 1221 (footnote omitted). While the pertinent statutes could have been drafted with terms that more precisely answer the specific question now before us, a common-sense reading of the various provisions leads us to conclude that the Legislature intended to empower both the Governor and the Attorney General to represent the State\\'s interests in litigation.', '¶34 To be clear, the broad authority of the Attorney General to represent the State is not nullified by the statutes which permit the Governor to select his own counsel. Rather, the Governor\\'s specific authority runs concurrently with the general authority of the Attorney General. A statutory interpretation to the contrary would create an absurd and inconsistent result, ignoring those provisions which allow the Governor to select his own counsel, and denying the Governor the ability to act where he is clearly authorized to do so. In addition to the authority expressly given by statute, a state officer generally has such powers \"as are necessary for the due and efficient exercise of the powers expressly granted, or such as may be fairly implied from the statute granting the express powers.\" Marley v. Cannon, 1980 OK 147, ¶ 10, 618 P.2d 401, 405 (citations omitted). The Governor may opt for the State\\'s interests to be represented by counsel other than the Attorney General -- this is necessarily implied from his express authority to retain his own counsel in the first place.', '¶35 In their briefs, both parties discuss State ex rel. Derryberry v. Kerr-McGee Corporation, 1973 OK 132, 516 P.2d 813. In Derryberry, a newly-elected Attorney General challenged the authority of his predecessor to settle a case. This Court stated that the \"Attorney General\\'s powers are as broad as the common law unless restricted or modified by statute, and that his authority to dismiss, settle or compromise the litigation in question, in the absence of fraud or collusion, is undisputed.\" Derryberry, 1973 OK 132, ¶ 27, 516 P.2d at 819 (emphasis added). In analyzing the issue, we made the following pronouncement, which both parties emphasize in their respective arguments:', 'Derryberry, 1973 OK 132, ¶ 20, 516 P.2d at 818 (emphasis added). The Attorney General invokes this quoted language in support of the proposition that he possesses complete dominion over the underlying federal case and may make exclusive litigation decisions there on behalf of the State.', '¶36 We disagree with the Attorney General\\'s interpretation of Derryberry. The above-quoted language recognizes that the Attorney General\\'s dominion over a case can be overridden by \"explicit legislative or constitutional expression to the contrary.\" Derryberry, 1973 OK 132, ¶ 20, 516 P.2d at 818 (emphasis added). In the present case, such legislative and constitutional expressions to the contrary clearly exist. As we outlined in detail above, the Governor has both specific legislative authority to select his own counsel as well as superior constitutional power as Chief Magistrate. In the presence of the unambiguous legal pronouncements establishing the Governor\\'s powers, the Attorney General may not assume control over the objection of the Governor -- especially in a lawsuit involving the Governor\\'s own actions, in which the Governor is named as a defendant, and where the Governor\\'s selected counsel has been handling the representation since 2021.', \"¶37 We hold that the Attorney General's statutory authority to take and assume control of the State's defense is subordinate to the Governor's constitutionally-granted Supreme Executive power, and statutorily-granted authority which gives him the right to represent the State and choose his counsel in defense of the action. See Okla. Const. art. VI, § 2; 74 O.S. §§ 6, 18c(A)(4)(a). Should the Attorney General enter an appearance on his own initiative, as authorized by Section 18b(A)(3), on his own behalf or on behalf of another State entity, he still may not take and assume control of the Governor's case where the Governor has employed his own counsel.\", 'E. Requests from the Speaker of the House and Senate Pro Tempore', '¶38 The Attorney General asserts that both the House of Representatives and the Senate have requested that he assume control of the Governor\\'s defense in the underlying case. He points to two letters sent to him -- one from the Speaker of the House and the other from the President Pro Tempore of the Senate -- in support of his appearance in the federal case.10 In the first letter, dated July 18, 2023, President Pro Tempore of the Oklahoma State Senate, Greg Treat, objected to the Governor\\'s defense of the gaming compacts at issue and asked the Attorney General to \"consider this my formal request under § 18b(A)(3) on behalf of the Oklahoma State Senate to assume control of the defense of the state\\'s interest\" in the federal case. Rec. at 1448. In the second letter, dated July 21, 2023, Speaker of the Oklahoma House of Representatives, Charles McCall, indicated that he was responding to the Attorney General\\'s request that the Legislature support his decision to intervene in the underlying case, and stated that \"while we believed you could intervene in federal litigation without legislative approval, you have taken the position that you cannot and therefore need our approval.\" Rec. at 1450. Rep. McCall stated that the \"House calls on you to act in the way you as Attorney General believe to be in the best interest of Oklahoma and if that means intervening then we call on you to act in accord with the letter you sent us and proceed on behalf of the state under 74 O.S. §18b(A)(3).\" Rec. at 1450. Neither letter references a vote of either chamber or otherwise indicates a legislative resolution directing the Attorney General to appear in the case.', '¶39 In response, the Governor furnished correspondence from another legislator, who challenged the support letters and pointed out the Legislature has approved no resolution regarding this case. Representative Tom Gann, in a letter to the Attorney General dated July 26, 2023, stated that Speaker McCall\\'s letter was \"not a reflection of the collective stance of the House of Representatives\" and \"certainly does not meet the legal requirements to represent \\'The Legislature\\' as outlined in Title 74 18b(A)(C) [sic].\"11', '¶40 The Attorney General maintains that, by virtue of the support letters from the Speaker and the President Pro Tem, he has authority to appear and assume control of the case pursuant to Derryberry. We disagree.', \"¶41 The Attorney General has furnished no persuasive authority that these letters from individual legislators constitute a proper request from either chamber of the Legislature.12 We need not, however, answer that question here. Whether or not these letters are adequate requests, we find no support in Title 74, Section 18b or elsewhere that the Legislature may direct the Attorney General to assume control and override the Governor's actions in the present case. We decline to adopt an interpretation which raises such obvious separation-of-powers concerns. The Governor has already exercised his constitutional and statutory authority, opting to retain counsel to represent the interests of the State in this case, where the Governor is a named defendant. We conclude that the Legislature's ability to invoke Attorney General involvement does not extend so far as to supersede the Governor's express powers in this proceeding.\", \"F. The Governor's Position in the Federal Lawsuit is Not Inconsistent with State Law\", \"¶42 The Attorney General argues that he has the power to take over representation of the State in the underlying federal case, over the objection of the Governor, because the gaming compacts are not valid under Oklahoma law and therefore the Governor's efforts to defend them in federal court are inconsistent with state law. The underlying case, however, involves more than just state law, and presents issues specific to the federal IGRA and its procedural nuances.\", \"¶43 Granted, whether or not the compacts received approval under the federal IGRA process, their invalidity under Oklahoma law has been decided by this Court in Treat I and Treat II. It is Oklahoma law that determines whether a tribal gaming compact is consistent with the IGRA. Treat v. Stitt, 2020 OK 64, ¶ 6, 473 P.3d 43, 45, as corrected (July 22, 2020) (Treat 1) (citing Pueblo of Santa Ana v. Kelly, 104 F.3d 1546, 1557 (10th Cir. 1997). Nonetheless, the very specific issue before the federal court goes one step further than that -- it concerns the timing of the federal process and whether the Secretary of the Interior's approval of the compacts under the IGRA is affected by the subsequent state court holdings. The Treat cases did not answer that question, as they dealt only with state law. Treat I at ¶ 3, 473 P.3d at 44 (issue before the Court is limited to whether the Governor had the authority to bind the State with respect to the new tribal gaming compacts under state law); Treat v. Stitt, 2021 OK 3, ¶ 3, 481 P.3d 240, 241 (Treat II) (state law prohibited the Governor from executing contracts with terms different from those in the Model Gaming Compact).\", '¶44 The IGRA is a federal statute, the interpretation of which presents a federal question suitable for determination by a federal court. See Pueblo of Santa Ana, supra, 104 F.3d at 1557 (10th Cir. 1997). It is within the purview of the federal court to articulate the impact, if any, which our Treat I and Treat II holdings have upon the approval of the compacts under the federal IGRA.', \"¶45 Governor Stitt, a named defendant in the federal case, does not contest this Court's findings in the Treat I and Treat II cases. Instead, his argument in the underlying case is that, as a matter of federal law, the after-the-fact state court decisions do not operate to unwind the federal approval process under the IGRA, and that any provisions which were subsequently determined to violate state law can be severed. See Memorandum of Law in Support of Defendant Governor J. Kevin Stitt's Rule 12(C) Motion, ECF # 154 and 154-1 at 18-21; Rec. at 1376-79. This Court need not attempt to predict how the federal court will rule on the merits, nor will we address questions regarding the interplay between the state and federal gaming laws which are not properly before us. That controversy should be allowed to play out in the D.C. District Court. We find no requirement in Oklahoma law that the Governor should abandon his arguments or his defense of the compacts in this regard.\", 'G. The Governor Has a Right to Counsel Who Will Represent His Interests', '¶46 The Attorney General seeks to enter his appearance in the federal case as counsel \"for J. Kevin Stitt, in his official capacity as the Governor of the State of Oklahoma.\" Notice of Appearance of Oklahoma Attorney General; Rec. at 1444. Because the Governor is named as a defendant in his official capacity, the Attorney General argues that the State of Oklahoma, and not the Governor, is the real party in interest. Thus, the Attorney General claims that he is simply seeking to represent the State of Oklahoma\\'s interests by taking and assuming control of the Governor\\'s defense.', '¶47 An individual\\'s \"official capacity\" usually refers to a person\\'s status as a legally recognized representative of an entity. Pellegrino v. State ex rel. Cameron Univ. ex rel. Bd. of Regents of State, 2003 OK 2, ¶ 5, 63 P.3d 535, 537 (citing Braswell v. U.S., 487 U.S. 99, 107--108, 108 S.Ct. 2284, 101 L.Ed.2d 98 (1988)). Suit against a government officer in his or her official capacity is actually a suit against the entity that the officer represents and is an attempt to impose liability upon the governmental entity. Speight v. Presley, 2008 OK 99, ¶ 20, 203 P.3d 173, 179. Pellegrino, 2003 OK 2, ¶ 5, 63 P.3d 535, 537 (citing McMillian v. Monroe County, 520 U.S. 781, 785, n. 2, 117 S.Ct. 1734, 138 L.Ed.2d 1 (1997)). In the federal-law context, the distinction is relevant for state sovereign immunity and Eleventh Amendment considerations, where a suit seeking damages against a state official is generally no different than a suit against the state itself.13', '¶48 To answer the question certified to this Court, we need not delve into the complexities of sovereign immunity of the State or its officials. The Plaintiff tribes named the Governor as a party defendant in the federal case, and neither party here has raised an argument challenging that. Although the State of Oklahoma is ultimately the real party in interest, we disagree that the Attorney General may seize control of the defense based upon that fact alone. The Governor, in his official capacity, is answerable on behalf of the State in the underlying matter, and we conclude that he possesses statutory and constitutional authority to represent the interests of the State of Oklahoma in that proceeding.', '¶49 From this conclusion, it flows logically that the Governor\\'s participation as a named defendant in the underlying case includes the choice of counsel who will represent the Governor\\'s position. We have held that the \"right to be represented by counsel ordinarily should include the right to make a choice, if timely exercised, of attorneys whose views are consonant with one\\'s own or who at least will present the client\\'s interests.\" State ex rel. Howard v. Oklahoma Corp. Comm\\'n, 1980 OK 96, ¶ 23, 614 P.2d 45, 50.', '¶50 In Howard, the Corporation Commission argued it had the right to be represented by its own in-house counsel, and that the Attorney General, whose views were at variance with those of the Corporation Commission, should be excluded from appearing for it. This Court agreed -- we reasoned that where an entity is subject to being brought into court, it has the right to defend pursuant to Article II, Sections 6 and 7 of the Oklahoma Constitution. Section 6 provides that \"[t]he courts of justice of the State shall be open to every person, and speedy and certain remedy afforded for every wrong and for every injury to person, property, or reputation; and right and justice shall be administered without sale, denial, delay, or prejudice.\" Okla. Const. art. II, § 6. Section 7 states \"[n]o person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\" Okla. Const. art. II, § 7.', '¶51 We reasoned that, if an entity has the constitutional right to defend, then \"surely it is entitled to the benefit of counsel.\" Howard, 1980 OK 96, ¶ 21, 614 P.2d at 49. Where the Corporation Commission may be brought into court, then the Oklahoma Constitution \"under any concept of affording it any semblance of even-handed justice, must require that it be represented if it so desires, by counsel who can and will ably and conscientiously express its views to the tribunal.\" Howard, 1980 OK 96, ¶ 25, 614 P.2d at 50.', \"¶52 Having been brought into the underlying federal case as a named defendant, the Governor may defend the claims -- here, his retained counsel has represented the State's interests as directed by the Governor since the case began in 2021. As in Howard, we conclude that the Governor, in defending the claims asserted against the State, is entitled to be represented by an attorney whose views are consonant with his own, or who at least will represent those views on his behalf in the federal case.\", \"H. The Sphere of the Attorney General's Responsibility\", '¶53 Our holding today answers the certified question, which asks only if the Attorney General may \"take and assume control\" of the \"defense of the state\\'s interest\" in the instant case. We note that in the Memorandum Opinion and Order, the federal court expresses it is skeptical that the Governor\\'s executive power sweeps so broadly as to prohibit the Attorney General from appearing for the State against the Governor\\'s wishes. Memorandum Opinion and Order; Rec. at 1521. The federal court then states that the parties have not referenced any Oklahoma case which addresses whether the Attorney General has a sphere of responsibility in which he may act independently from the Governor, and if so, the contours of that sphere. Id.', \"¶54 We clarify that our conclusion today does not nullify the Attorney General's authority to appear ex officio in the present case. The following statement in Howard provides pertinent guidance:\", 'Howard, 1980 OK 96, ¶ 26, 614 P.2d at 50-51.', \"¶55 We agree with the federal court's skepticism about extending the Governor's power to unilaterally prevent the Attorney General from appearing in the case. By virtue of his office, the Attorney General may act independently from the Governor, and represent such segment of the State's interest not represented by the Governor. We will not attempt to predict the manner in which the Attorney General's involvement will correspond or conflict with the Governor's defense, or potentially impact the progress of the case. As with all complex litigation involving multiple parties with competing interests, judicial economy is balanced with other considerations of fairness and fundamental rights. We defer to the federal court to determine that portion of the State's interests, if any, which warrants additional involvement by the Attorney General versus those views which are adequately represented by the other parties in the case.\", 'V. CONCLUSION', \"¶56 The Governor possesses statutory and constitutional authority to represent the interests of the State of Oklahoma in the underlying case, and his participation includes the choice of counsel who will represent the Governor's position. The Attorney General is authorized to appear as discussed herein, but he may not take and assume control of the defense of the State's interests in the present case, over the objection of the Governor, where the Governor has lawfully retained his own counsel.\", 'CERTIFIED QUESTION ANSWERED', 'Rowe, C.J., Kuehn, V.C.J., Winchester, Edmondson, Combs (by separate writing), Gurich, Darby, Kane, JJ., concur', 'FOOTNOTES', '1 The Plaintiff tribes also sued the U.S. Department of the Interior and related federal officials there, as well as the leaders of the tribes who entered into the compacts with Governor Stitt.

The Secretary did not respond to those objections, and instead took no action within the forty-five-day period.', \"8 We issued Treat I on July 21, 2020 (reh'g denied Sept. 14, 2020), applicable to the Comanche Nation and Otoe-Missouria compacts.

We need not decide here whether either rule authorizes these individuals, without a legislative resolution and vote, to direct the Attorney General to intervene and assume control in any case, especially one which does not directly involve either chamber of the Legislature.', '13 We are aware of no Eleventh Amendment arguments raised by the Governor or the Attorney General in the present case. This is not surprising, as exceptions to the Eleventh Amendment are implicated to the extent that the Plaintiff tribes seek declaratory relief rather than monetary damages against the State. See, e.g., Fowler v. Stitt, 104 F.4th 770, 781--83 (10th Cir. 2024) (citations omitted) (holding that the Eleventh Amendment did not prohibit claims for injunctive and declaratory relief against Governor Stitt and other officials in their official capacities).

We granted certiorari and now conclude the trial court's refusal to consider economic stimulus payments, which were received by Father and credited by him to Mother's child support debt, was an abuse of discretion.

Simultaneously, the Boehms filed an application which requested an order determining that the children are eligible for adoption without the consent of their biological mother. As the sole basis for this request, the Boehms alleged \"[f]or twelve (12) of the last fourteen (14) months Brittney Ramirez, willfully failed, refused or neglected to contribute to the financial support of the children in compliance with [a prior order of the district court] and according to her financial ability.\"1 After three days of testimony on the application, the trial judge determined that the minor children were eligible for adoption without Ramirez\\'s consent. An order to that effect was filed on May 5, 2022. Mother brought the present appeal after a final Decree of Adoption was approved and filed on September 27, 2022. In a 2-1 decision, the Court of Civil Appeals (COCA), Division I, affirmed that judgment by opinion issued on October 26, 2023.

Jared Boehm (Father) is the biological father of B.R.B. and A.M.B. and the legal father of N.J.B. through a decree of adoption entered on December 4, 2015.2 Mother and Father were divorced on July 21, 2020, in Garfield County. Father was awarded sole custody of the minor children with Mother permitted visitation based on a schedule attached to the parties' decree of dissolution. According to the decree, Mother was directed to pay child support for the three minor children in the amount of $50.00 per month. Mother's child support payments were due on the first of each month, beginning on July 1, 2020.\", \"¶3 On October 8, 2021, Father married Brandi N. Jenkins, now Brandi N. Boehm (Stepmother). Less than three months later, on January 3, 2022, Father and Stepmother initially filed their joint petition seeking an order permitting Stepmother to adopt N.J.B., B.R.B., and A.M.B.; however, this was dismissed by the petitioners on April 1, 2022. The same day, Father and Stepmother filed a second joint petition to adopt under a separate case number.3 The Petitioners simultaneously filed an application requesting an order allowing the three minor children to be adopted without Mother's consent. While the petition sets forth two grounds for the adoption without Mother's consent, the application only alleged Mother had failed to pay child support as ordered for twelve of the fourteen months preceding the filing of the petition and application. Thus, the relevant fourteen-month period of time to evaluate Mother's compliance with the child support order would have been from February 1, 2021 through April 1, 2022. An attorney for the children was appointed by court order on April 22, 2022.\", \"¶4 A hearing on the application to allow the adoption to proceed without Mother's consent took place on May 5, 2022. The only witnesses were Mother, Father, and Father's certified public accountant, Misty Taylor. Mother testified that she was employed during the fourteen-month period preceding the petition for adoption. During the time frame, Mother tendered two monthly child support payments in full to Father: (1) a payment in the amount of $50.00 in February 2021 and (2) a check for $100.00 in August 2021. Mother's child support payments were clearly inconsistent; yet she utilized funds for questionable personal expenses during the relevant period.\", \"¶5 Father received an economic stimulus payment4 from the United States Treasury in January 2021. The same month he credited Mother with $600.00, payable toward her child support obligation. Father also received a $7,000.00 stimulus payment on March 16, 2021. CPA Misty Taylor testified that the March 2021 stimulus payment was based on the 2019 federal tax return filed jointly by Mother and Father.5 Mother believed that $1,400.00 of the March 2021 stimulus money was for her benefit; however, Father refused to pay her any of those funds. Instead, in January 2022, Mother filed a motion in the parties' underlying divorce case requesting the stimulus money be accounted for and applied to any outstanding child support, medical expenses, or childcare. Further, the motion noted Father's refusal to utilize Mother's SoonerCare coverage for the children as secondary insurance.6 In her verified motion, Mother maintained there would not have been any unpaid medical expenses if Father had utilized SoonerCare as secondary insurance.\", '¶6 During his testimony, Father explained that he had provided Mother with a spreadsheet which detailed what he believed were past-due amounts for child support, childcare, and unreimbursed medical expenses. Nevertheless, he only provided Mother with \"some\" of the receipts corroborating the figures set forth in the spreadsheet. Mother acknowledged that she had a legal responsibility to pay her proportionate share of childcare and out-of-pocket medical expenses. Mother\\'s responsibility for out-of-pocket medical and childcare was sixteen percent (16%), and under the parties\\' divorce decree, she was allowed forty-five days to repay these amounts after being provided with receipts for the expenses.

See Matter of Adoption of M.A.S., 2018 OK 1, ¶ 15, 419 P.3d 204, 211 (\"The statute, strictly applied, requires any failure on Father\\'s part to substantially comply with the support order to occur for twelve consecutive months and the failure must also be willful.\") (emphasis in original).', '¶14 A party requesting a court order allowing an adoption without consent must prove by clear and convincing evidence that one or more of the statutory criteria have been met.

In approximately January 2021, Father credited Mother with a $600.00 payment based on a federal stimulus check paid directly to Father\\'s account. Although this sum was received prior to the fourteen-month lookback period, Mother testified that she believed the sum should have been credited to her future child support obligations. While Father certainly has a legitimate claim that the $600.00 should first be applied to unpaid childcare and medical expenses, the amount of those unpaid obligations was contested. The undisputed evidence also reflects Mother paid $50.00 in February 2021 and $100.00 in August 2021 toward her child support obligation. Finally, Father received another large federal stimulus payment in March 2021, $1,400.00 of which was attributable to Mother based on the parties\\' 2019 federal income tax return. Mother requested the stimulus monies be credited to child support and childcare in the parents\\' divorce case. Father declined to tender or credit any portion of the money to Mother until three days after the adoption without consent hearing. Had the $1,400.00 stimulus check been applied to Mother\\'s child support obligation when received, Mother would have been current or nearly current on base child support, childcare, and unpaid medical expenses.', '¶15 Our case law supports the determination that any economic stimulus payments connected to Mother\\'s social security number on the parties\\' joint tax return, which were received and credited by Father, should have been considered by the trial court when evaluating the application to allow adoption without consent in this case. We have previously found that social security disability insurance (SSDI) payments made to a child because of a parent\\'s disability should be applied as an offset to an outstanding child support debt. Merritt v. Merritt, 2003 OK 68, ¶ 19, 73 P.3d 878, 884. In Merritt, the father was awarded sole custody of a minor child and the mother was ordered to pay child support of $120.00 per month. Several years later, the father initiated a contempt application against mother for unpaid child support. Although the mother had not been making monthly child support payments, during pendency of the contempt matter, the Social Security Administration made a lump sum payment directly to the child and began paying the child monthly SSDI benefits. These amounts exceeded the mother\\'s monthly child support obligation. The trial court sustained mother\\'s motion to dismiss the contempt proceeding and the COCA reversed, finding the SSDI payments did not extinguish the unpaid child support debt. We granted certiorari and reinstated the trial court\\'s judgment on alternative grounds, finding \"[i]n the case before us, Social Security benefits have been paid for child support. The amount paid was in excess of that owed as an arrearage. The mother is entitled to credit for that payment.\" Id.', \"¶16 We believe the same rationale used in Merritt should be extended to the economic stimulus payments in this case. Although there are no prior Oklahoma decisions addressing the application of stimulus monies to satisfy a child support debt, the trial court should have considered those funds when weighing the application in this case. The stimulus payments were calculated based on the number of adult taxpayers and dependents on each return filed. See 26 U.S.C. § 6428(a), 26 U.S.C. § 6428A(a), and 26 U.S.C. § 6428B(b). As explained by Father's CPA, the money received by Father in March 2021 was based on the parties' joint 2019 federal tax return, thus a portion of the funds were clearly attributable to Mother's taxpayer identification number. Father's receipt of the stimulus monies, along with his history of crediting Mother's child support with those funds, should have been considered by the trial court in determining whether there had been willful nonpayment of child support under 10 O.S.2021, § 7505-4.2. The economic stimulus monies were nothing more than a source of disposable income for recipients of the funds. Nothing would have limited Mother from using her share of those funds to pay back child support. If those funds had been credited to Mother before the hearing on Petitioners' application, she undoubtedly would have been in substantial compliance with the underlying child support order for the entire fourteen-month period. Regardless, the record does not establish twelve consecutive months of willful non-payment of child support in accordance with the parties' decree of dissolution.10 During the term at issue, Mother tendered two payments in full, one of which was for more than the monthly obligation (Feb. and Aug. 2021). These were in full compliance with the monthly child support obligation, thus interrupting the requirement that substantial non-compliance be for twelve consecutive months. Given the totality of circumstances, we find the record does not present clear and convincing evidence to support the order allowing adoption without consent in this case.\", '¶17 The paramount consideration in any adoption proceeding is the best interest of a child. 10 O.S.2021, § 7501-1.2(A)(1); In re Adoption of C.D.M., 2001 OK 103, ¶ 23, 39 P.3d 802, 811. As we have noted, \"the best interests of the child do not exist in a legal vacuum in which parental rights have no weight in determining physical custody. The child\\'s interests must be determined in conjunction with [a parent\\'s] fundamental constitutional right to the care and custody of [their] child.\" Murrell v. Cox, 2009 OK 93, ¶ 30, 226 P.3d 692, 699. There is a presumption that a child\\'s best interests are best served by being in the custody of their natural parents. Id.', \"¶18 When this evidence is viewed in light of the constitutional mandates protecting parental rights, it is clear: (a) any failure to pay monthly child support was not willful based on Father's receipt of stimulus monies, which he applied to Mother's child support debt on two occasions; (b) combining the stimulus payments and actual child support payments made during the twelve-month period, there was not clear and convincing evidence supporting the trial court's order allowing adoption without consent; and (c) even if the stimulus payments are excluded from consideration, the record does not reflect twelve consecutive months of substantial non-compliance during the relevant period.\", 'CONCLUSION', \"¶19 The trial court's decision to not consider economic stimulus payments, which were received by Father and credited by him to Mother's child support debt, was an abuse of discretion. These sums should have been included in the determination of whether Mother willfully failed to substantially comply with the child support order for twelve consecutive months out of the fourteen months preceding the adoption petition. Accordingly, the order allowing Stepmother to adopt N.J.B., B.R.B, and A.M.B. without Mother's consent is reversed. Because we reverse the trial court's decision on this basis, there is no need to consider the trial court's order of September 8, 2022, finding allowing the adoption without consent to be in the best interest of the children. Consequently, the Final Decree of Adoption and the subsequent Order Nunc Pro Tunc are also reversed.\", \"¶20 For the reasons set forth herein, the trial court's orders, filed May 5, 2022, September 8, 2022, and September 27, 2022, are reversed, and the matter is remanded with instructions for the trial court to enter an order denying the application to allow adoption without consent.\", 'CERTIORARI PREVIOUSLY GRANTED; COURT OF CIVIL\\nAPPEALS DECISION VACATED; TRIAL COURT \\nREVERSED AND THE CAUSE REMANDED FOR \\nPROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.', 'CONCUR: ROWE, C.J., WINCHESTER, EDMONDSON, COMBS, AND GURICH, JJ.', 'DISSENT: KUEHN, V.C.J.

We hold it does not. The current residency restrictions in 57 O.S.Supp.2019, § 590(A) apply to all sex offenders, regardless of when they became subject to the provisions of SORA.', 'FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY', '¶2 Plaintiff/Appellee Kelly Patrick Donaldson was charged with first degree rape, in violation of 21 O.S.2001, § 1114(A)(1), in CF-2005-59, in Woodward County District Court. At the time of the commission of the crime, Donaldson was 25 years-old and the victim was under the age of 14. On April 20, 2005, Donaldson pled guilty to second degree rape, in violation of 21 O.S.2001, § 1114(B). Donaldson was sentenced to fifteen years in prison with all but the first six years suspended. As a result of his conviction, he became subject to the provisions of SORA.1 Donaldson was designated as an aggravated sex offender and is required to register and comply with the provisions of SORA for life.2', \"¶3 Donaldson was initially released from prison and began registering as a sex offender in December 2007. He was arrested again on June 15, 2009 and charged with plotting to murder his probation officer in CF-2009-329, in Bryan County District Court. In September 2012, Donaldson pled no contest and was sentenced to ten years in prison to run concurrently with the sentence on the rape conviction. The District Court of Woodward County revoked Donaldson's suspended sentence on the rape conviction on December 12, 2012. Donaldson was released from prison on or around December 31, 2015, at which time he registered as a sex offender and moved into an apartment in Oklahoma City.\", '¶4 On December 17, 2021, Donaldson inquired with the El Reno Police Department whether he could live at a residence in El Reno, Oklahoma. The El Reno Police Department advised him that he could not reside on the property, because 57 O.S.Supp.2019, § 590(A) prohibited registered sex offenders from residing within a 2,000-foot radius of a city park, and the property was located 310 feet from Lake El Reno, which Defendant/Appellee City of El Reno contends is a park owned, operated, and maintained by the City.', \"¶5 Despite the El Reno Police Department's admonition, Donaldson purchased the property. He then filed the underlying action against the City seeking a declaratory judgment that applying the 2019 version of the residency restrictions to him violated the ex post facto clauses in Article 1, § 10 of the United States Constitution and Article 2, § 15 of the Oklahoma Constitution.\", \"¶6 The parties filed competing motions for summary judgment. Donaldson argued that the law in effect on the date of his conviction applied, and, on April 20, 2005, SORA did not prohibit registered sex offenders from residing within 2,000 feet of a park. See 57 O.S.Supp.2004, § 590 (only prohibited living withing a 2,000-foot radius of any public or private school site or educational institution). The Oklahoma Legislature amended SORA one year later to prohibit sex offenders from residing within 2,000 feet of a park. See 2006 Okla. Sess. Laws, ch. 284, § 11 (eff. June 7, 2006) (codified as 57 O.S.Supp.2006, § 590). Donaldson's position was that because the Oklahoma Supreme Court, in Starkey v. Oklahoma Department of Corrections, 2013 OK 43, 305 P.3d 1004, determined SORA's effects were punitive, subsequent amendments to the residency restrictions retroactively imposed or increased his punishment in violation of the ban on ex post facto laws. City argued Starkey did not decide the constitutionality of the residency restrictions. City contended that the residency restrictions were nonpunitive, civil regulations, and, therefore, applying the current law to persons who became subject to SORA before the effective date of the amendments did not violate the ex post facto clause of either the federal or state Constitution.\", '¶7 Donaldson further argued that, even if the court found the current residency restrictions applied to him, Lake El Reno is not a \"park\" for purposes of 57 O.S.Supp.2019, § 590(A). The City argued that it was undisputed that Donaldson\\'s property was located approximately 310 feet of the nearest property line of Lake El Reno and that Lake El Reno constitutes a \"park\" for purposes of 57 O.S.Supp.2019, § 590(A).', \"¶8 The trial court granted summary judgment to Donaldson. The trial court concluded the residency restrictions were so punitive in nature that applying the 2019 version of 57 O.S., § 590 to Donaldson would violate both the federal and state prohibitions against ex post facto laws. See U.S. Const. art. 1, § 10; Okla. Const. art. 2, § 15. Relying on Starkey and Graham v. Carrington Place Property Owners Ass'n, 2019 OK CIV APP 33, 456 P.3d 1137, the trial court found the version of the law in effect at the time of Donaldson's conviction controlled and, on April 20, 2005, SORA did not prohibit sex offenders from residing within 2,000 feet of a city park. The trial court found that, because the residency restrictions did not apply to Donaldson, the issue of whether Lake El Reno was a park was moot.\", \"¶9 City appeals. This Court granted Donaldson's motion to retain the appeal and ordered additional briefing. The Oklahoma Attorney General intervened in the appeal, and the Oklahoma Municipal League was permitted to file a brief as amicus curiae. Oral arguments were heard by the Court en banc on November 30, 2023.\", 'STANDARD OF REVIEW', '¶10 The constitutionality, construction, and application of a statute are questions of law to be reviewed de novo.

In exercising de novo review, \"this Court possesses plenary, independent, and non-deferential authority to examine the issues presented.\" Id. ¶ 6, 381 P.3d at 740.

The party seeking a ruling that a statute is unconstitutional has the burden to show the statute is clearly, palpably, and plainly inconsistent with the Constitution. See Lafalier v.

See Collins v. Youngblood, 497 U.S. 37, 42 (1990) (citing Beazell v. Ohio, 269 U.S. 167, 169-70 (1925)); Starkey, 2013 OK 43, ¶ 37, 305 P.3d at 1018 (citing definitions from Collins and Beazell). \"Legislatures may not retroactively alter the definition of crimes or increase the punishment for criminal acts.\" Collins, 497 U.S. at 43.', 'II. The Legislature Intended for the Residency Restrictions to Apply \\nRetroactively', '¶13 The Oklahoma Legislature first adopted residency restrictions for sex offenders in 2003. The first rendition prohibited registered sex offenders from residing within a 2,000-foot radius of a public or private school or educational institution. See 2003 Okla. Sess. Laws, ch. 223, § 1 (eff. Nov. 1, 2003) (codified as 57 O.S.Supp.2003, § 590).4 When Donaldson was convicted of second degree rape, that was the law. See 57 O.S.Supp.2004, § 590. Section 590 did not prohibit registered sex offenders from living within 2,000 feet of a park until the Legislature expanded the residency restrictions in June 2006.5 The residency restrictions have since been amended numerous times.6 Title 57, § 590(A) currently provides:', '57 O.S.Supp.2019, § 590(A) (eff. Nov. 1, 2019) (emphasis added).', \"¶14 The issue is whether the current version of 57 O.S., § 590(A) applies to Donaldson, a person who was convicted and required to register under SORA prior to the Legislature amending the statute to prohibit sex offenders from living within a 2,000-foot radius of a park. We begin by looking at the statutory language to determine whether the Legislature even intended for the amendments to apply retroactively to persons required to register prior to the new restrictions going into effect. If it did not, the analysis ends there. The ex post facto clause prohibits retroactively imposing or increasing punishment. If the Legislature intended for the amended residency restrictions to apply only prospectively to sex offenders required to register on or after the amendment's effective date, there can be no ex post facto issue.7 But, if the Legislature intended that the new residency restrictions also apply to sex offenders who were required to register prior to the effective date of the amendment, an ex post facto analysis is warranted.\", '¶15 Amendments to the law are generally presumed to operate prospectively unless the Legislature\\'s intent to give it retrospective effect is expressly declared or it is necessarily implied from the language in the statute. See Dolese Bros. Co. v. State ex rel. Okla. Tax Comm\\'n, 2003 OK 4, ¶ 8, 64 P.3d 1093, 1097; Wickham v. Gulf Oil Corp., 1981 OK 8, ¶ 13, 623 P.2d 613, 615-616; Good v. Keel, 1911 OK 264, ¶ 4, 116 P. 777, 777. \"If there is any doubt, it must be resolved against retroactivity.\" Dolese, 2003 OK 4, ¶ 8, 64 P.3d at 1097 (citations omitted); see Good, 1911 OK 264, ¶ 4, 116 P. at 777.', '¶16 We find the Legislature intended for the residency restrictions, as amended, to apply retroactively to sex offenders who were already required to register prior to the effective date of the amendment.8 The Legislature did not make an express declaration. However, the legislative intent to give the statute retroactive effect is necessarily implied by the language used: \"It is unlawful for any person registered pursuant to the Sex Offenders Registration Act to reside . . . .\" 57 O.S.Supp.2019, § 590(A) (emphasis added). This language was included when the residency restrictions were originally enacted in 2003, when the Legislature first added a park restriction in 2006, and in every version through the most recent amendments in 2019. The language \"any person registered\" clearly indicates the residency restrictions apply to all sex offenders required to register under SORA. That includes persons already registered when the law goes into effect and persons who will be required to register after the effective date of the amendments. The legislative intent is that all sex offenders, regardless of when they first become subject to the provisions of SORA, are to comply with the amended residency restrictions.', \"¶17 The pertinent question then becomes: are the residency restrictions punitive? If the residency restrictions are punitive, the amendment cannot be applied retroactively, because the ex post facto clause prohibits retroactively imposing or increasing punishment for a crime. But if the residency restrictions are not punitive, the ex post facto clause is not implicated, and it is within the Legislature's discretion to give the provisions retroactive effect.\", 'III. Intent-Effects Test', '¶18 In the seminal case Smith v. Doe, 538 U.S. 84 (2003), the United States Supreme Court set forth what has become known as the \"intent-effects\" test for determining whether the retroactive application of sex offender registration laws violates the ex post facto clause of the United States Constitution. We adopted this test in Starkey v. Oklahoma Department of Corrections, 2013 OK 43, ¶ 41, 305 P.3d 1004, 1019.', '¶19 The ex post facto clause applies only to criminal or penal laws. Therefore, the initial inquiry is whether the legislature intended for the provision to be civil or criminal. Smith, 538 U.S. at 92-93; Starkey, 2013 OK 43, ¶ 41, 305 P.3d at 1019-20. If the legislature intended to impose punishment, it is criminal, and the ex post facto clause prohibits its retroactive application. Id. But, if the legislature intended for the provision to be part of a civil, non-punitive regulatory scheme, we apply the intent-effects test to determine whether the civil, regulatory provision is so punitive, either in purpose or effect, as to negate that intent. See Smith, 538 U.S. at 92 (citing Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U.S. 346, 361 (1997)); Starkey, 2013 OK 43, ¶ 41, 305 P.3d at 1020. In evaluating the punitive effects of the law, both the United States Supreme Court and the Oklahoma Supreme Court consider five of the factors identified in Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U.S. 144 (1963):', 'Smith, 538 U.S. at 97; Starkey, 2013 OK 43, ¶ 46, 305 P.3d at 1021. For challenges based on the Oklahoma Constitution, this Court considers two additional factors9 from Mendoza-Martinez:', 'Starkey, 2013 OK 43, ¶ 46, 305 P.3d at 1021. The factors listed are \"neither exhaustive nor dispositive.\" Smith, 538 U.S. at 97 (quoting United States v. Ward, 448 U.S. 242, 249 (1980)); see Starkey, 2013 OK 43, ¶ 46, 305 P.3d at 1021. In weighing the Mendoza-Martinez factors, the United States Supreme Court has said: \"Because we ordinarily defer to the legislature\\'s stated intent, only the clearest proof will suffice to override that intent and transform what has been denominated a civil remedy into a criminal penalty.\" Smith, 538 U.S. at 92 (internal quotations and citations omitted); see Starkey, 2013 OK 43, ¶ 77, 305 P.3d at 1030.10 If the punitive effects do not clearly outweigh the non-punitive intent, the law is civil, and the ex post facto clause does not prohibit the retroactive application of civil laws.', 'IV. Starkey v. Oklahoma Department of Corrections', \"¶20 We agree with City that Starkey is not dispositive of the issue presented in this case. Mr. Starkey pled nolo contendere to sexual assault of a minor child and received a deferred judgment in Texas in 1998. See Starkey, 2013 OK 43, ¶ 1, 305 P.3d at 1008-09. Mr. Starkey entered and intended to remain in Oklahoma in 1998, at which time he became subject to the provisions of SORA. Id. ¶¶ 2-3, at 1009 (citing 57 O.S.Supp.1997 & Supp.1998, § 582; 57 O.S.Supp.1997, § 583). When Mr. Starkey first became subject to SORA in 1998, he was required to register for ten years. See 57 O.S.Supp.1997, § 583(C)-(D). In 2004, amendments to 57 O.S., § 583 effectively extended Starkey's registration period to twenty years. See 57 O.S.Supp.2004, § 583(C)-(D), (F); Starkey, 2013 OK 43, ¶ 33, 305 P.3d at 1017. Then, in 2007 and 2008, the Oklahoma Legislature amended SORA by adopting a risk level assignment system that applied to sex offenders convicted in Oklahoma and sex offenders with convictions in other jurisdictions who move to Oklahoma, respectively. See 57 O.S.Supp.2007 & Supp.2008 §§ 582.1-582.5; Starkey, 2013 OK 43, ¶¶ 4-5, 305 P.3d at 1010. Just before Mr. Starkey's ten-year registration period was set to expire, the Oklahoma Department of Corrections (DOC) assigned him level 3, which required him to register for life. See Starkey, 2013 OK 43, ¶ 8, 305 P.3d at 1010; see also 57 O.S.Supp.2008, § 583(B)-(D). The issue in Starkey was whether applying these amendments, which had the effect of extending Starkey's registration period from ten years to life, retroactively increased his punishment.\", \"¶21 In Starkey, we adopted Smith's analytical framework for evaluating ex post facto challenges under the Oklahoma Constitution. See Starkey, 2013 OK 43, ¶ 41, 305 P.3d at 1019. However, our analysis of SORA under the ex post facto clause of the Oklahoma Constitution reached the opposite conclusion of the United States Supreme Court in its analysis of Alaska's act under the federal ex post facto clause in Smith.11 The Starkey Court determined that the cumulative effects of SORA's requirements and restrictions were punitive and outweighed SORA's nonpunitive purpose. Id. ¶ 77, at 1030. Therefore, applying amendments that extended a sex offender's registration period retroactively increased the sanctions imposed in violation of the ex post facto clause of the Oklahoma Constitution. Id. ¶¶ 78-79, at 1030. In the simplest terms, Starkey says the State can't keep moving the finish line.\", '¶22 The issue presented in Starkey is not presented in this appeal. Donaldson admits that at the time of his conviction, the law provided he was to be designated as an aggravated sex offender and that he is required to register for life. Donaldson does not contend that subsequent amendments to the residency restrictions in 57 O.S., § 590 extended his registration period. Rather, the issue currently before this Court is whether the retroactive application of subsequent amendments to 57 O.S., § 590, which prohibit sex offenders from living within 2,000 feet of a city park, are punitive.', '¶23 We did not determine, in Starkey, that the residency restrictions in 57 O.S.Supp.2012, § 590(A) or any of the other individual requirements imposed by SORA were punitive and violated the ex post facto clause of the Oklahoma Constitution. The Starkey Court emphasized that \"[o]ur scope is focused on the constitutionality of retroactively extending SORA registration. . . . Having found SORA\\'s effects to be punitive, we find the retroactive extension of its registration period violates the prohibition on ex post facto laws provided in Article 2, § 15 of the Oklahoma Constitution.\" Starkey, 2013 OK 43, ¶ 79, 305 P.3d at 1030 (emphasis in original). In applying the intent-effects test, the court looked at SORA\\'s various requirements--including residency restrictions--and their cumulative effects to determine if extending the registration period was punitive. The residency restrictions in 57 O.S., § 590 were taken into account when the Court evaluated three of the seven Mendoza-Martinez factors--affirmative disability or restraint,12 sanctions that have been historically considered punishment,13 and deterrence and retribution as traditional aims of punishment.14 However, while observing that these factors weighed in favor of a punitive effect, the Court was careful to state that it was not determining the constitutionality of the residency restrictions or any of the other individual requirements assessed as part of the intent-effects analysis. See Starkey, 2013 OK 43, ¶ 57, 305 P.3d at 1025 (\"We do not make any determination of the constitutionality of any of the individual registration requirements but have reviewed the requirements in their totality to address the cumulative effect on the issue of the first Mendoza-Martinez factor and the punitive effect of the act in its totality.\"); id. ¶ 61, 305 P.3d at 1026 (\"Again, we are not making a determination of the constitutionality of any of these individual registration requirements but for purposes of analyzing the second Mendoza-Martinez factor we find the totality of these requirements weigh in favor of punishment.\"); see also Fry v. State ex rel. Dep\\'t of Corr., 2017 OK 77, ¶ 5, 404 P.3d 38, 40 (\"The Starkey case did not purport to prohibit the retroactive effect of every provision in the Sex Offenders Registration Act.\").', '¶24 We reject Donaldson\\'s argument and the trial court\\'s conclusion that Starkey says--for every provision of SORA--the version in effect on the date of his conviction applies. This conclusion is beyond the scope of Starkey and its progeny. The so-called \"date of conviction\" rule was born out of Starkey. The Starkey Court concluded that, because the ex post facto clause prohibited the Legislature from giving retroactive effect to amendments having the effect of extending the registration period, the version of SORA in effect when Mr. Starkey became subject to SORA determined the length of his registration period. See Starkey, 2013 OK 43, ¶ 82, 305 P.3d at 1031. If, as in Starkey, the conviction is in a foreign jurisdiction, the offender becomes subject to the provisions of SORA when he or she voluntarily enters and intends to remain in Oklahoma after the conviction. Id. If the conviction is in Oklahoma, the offender becomes subject to the provisions of SORA on the date of his or her conviction. See Cerniglia v. Okla. Dep\\'t of Corrs., 2013 OK 81, ¶ 6, 349 P.3d 542, 544 (clarifying Starkey). This is commonly referred to as the \"date of conviction\" rule even when an offender becomes subject to SORA by entering the state. The date of conviction rule has been applied to determine whether a person is required to register, the length of the registration period, whether the level assignment system applies, and how frequently the offender must verify his or her registration information.15', \"¶25 Starkey and the date of conviction rule tell us that the law in effect on April 20, 2005--the date of Donaldson's conviction--determines if and for how long Donaldson is subject to SORA. And, as discussed above, that is not in dispute.\", '¶26 Starkey is not dispositive of the issue presented in this case: whether the statute prohibiting a registered sex offender from residing within a 2,000-foot radius of a city park is punitive. A separate analysis of this specific provision is required.', 'V. Step One of the Intent-Effects Test: Did the Legislature Intend for the \\nResidency Restrictions to be Civil or Criminal?', '¶27 We will now apply the analytical framework established in Smith and adopted by this Court in Starkey to determine whether the residency restrictions in 57 O.S.Supp.2019, § 590(A) are punitive and constitute retroactive punishment in violation of the ex post facto clause of the Oklahoma Constitution.', '¶28 Our initial inquiry in the intent-effects test is whether the legislature intended for the provision to be civil or criminal. See Smith, 538 U.S. at 92-93; Starkey, 2013 OK 43, ¶ 41, 305 P.3d at 1019. Section 581 of SORA provides:', '57 O.S.Supp.1997, § 581(B). In Starkey, this Court recognized \"[t]he non-punitive objective revealed in § 581 is to protect the public from sex offenders re-offending after release from custody.\" 2013 OK 43, ¶ 70, 305 P.3d at 1028. The Legislature did not label SORA as \"civil.\" However, we find the legislative intent of SORA is not to punish. Rather, 57 O.S., § 590 and amendments thereto, which prohibit sex offenders from living near areas where children congregate, are part of the civil, regulatory system intended to reduce recidivism and protect the public, specifically children.16', 'VI. Step Two of the Intent-Effects Test: Are the Residency Restrictions So \\nPunitive, Either in Purpose or Effect, as to Negate that Civil Intent?', '¶29 Next, we must weigh whether the effects of the residency restrictions are so punitive as to negate the civil intent. See Smith, 538 U.S. at 92; Starkey, 2013 OK 43, ¶¶ 41, 46, 305 P.3d at 1020-21. \"[O]nly the \\'clearest proof\\' will suffice to override legislative intent and transform what has been denominated a civil remedy into a criminal penalty.\" Smith, 538 U.S. at 92; see Starkey, 2013 OK 43, ¶ 77, 305 P.3d at 1030. We evaluate the punitive effects of § 590(A) by applying the Mendoza-Martinez factors.', '(1) Whether the law imposes an affirmative disability or restraint', '¶30 Unlike imprisonment,--\"the paradigmatic affirmative disability or restraint\"--the residency restrictions do not impose any physical restraints. Smith, 538 U.S. at 100. The residency restrictions in 57 O.S., § 590 limit where Donaldson can live, but they do not limit where he can go. Nonetheless, limiting where sex offenders can live imposes a disability or restraint. While minor and indirect restraints are unlikely to have a punitive effect, see Starkey, 2013 OK 43, ¶ 47, 305 P.3d at 1021 (citing Smith, 538 U.S. at 100), we agree with Donaldson that restraints on where a person may reside are significant and direct. We do not reach this conclusion based on evidence that Donaldson and other sex offenders cannot procure appropriate housing due to a large geographic area being restricted by 57 O.S.Supp.2019, § 590(A). Donaldson produced no such evidence. Donaldson claims a 50% reduction in housing and that the residency restrictions \"freeze out\" offenders from large swaths of communities. However, he has failed to cite any authority or evidence in the record to support his arguments. Rather, we find restraints on where one may reside are significant and direct because a person spends a substantial amount of time at his or her residence. Furthermore, a home is not simply a shelter; it is deeply personal and the center of daily living. Personal preference, affordability, and the specific needs of the household determine the type, size, price, style, and location of one\\'s residence.', '¶31 We find the residency restrictions impose some degree of affirmative disability or restraint on Donaldson and other sex offenders, which weighs in favor of a punitive effect.17 However, this factor, alone, does not make the statute punitive. \"[T]he imposition of an affirmative restraint \\'does not inexorably lead to the conclusion that the government has imposed punishment.\\'\" Doe v. Miller, 405 F.3d 700, 721 (8th Cir. 2005) (quoting Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U.S. 346, 363 (1997)).\" After all, many civil regulations impose an affirmative disability or restraint. For instance, zoning regulations impose similar restraints upon citizens. The degree of restraint must be balanced against the Oklahoma Legislature\\'s countervailing non-punitive purpose. See id.', '(2) Whether it has been historically considered punishment', \"¶32 Donaldson points to this Court's acknowledgment in Starkey that the residency restrictions are analogous to the traditional punishment of banishment. See Starkey, 2013 OK 43, ¶ 60, 305 P.3d at 1025-26. Persuaded by a Kentucky Supreme Court's decision with respect to this single factor, we concluded:\", 'Starkey, 2013 OK 43, ¶¶ 60-61, 305 P.3d at 1026 (citing Commonwealth v. Baker, 295 S.W.3d 437, 444 (Ky. 2009)).', \"¶33 First, it is important to note that Donaldson is not being forced to move from his residence. Donaldson was convicted and became subject to SORA in 2005. When SORA was first amended to prohibit residing within 2,000 feet of a park in 2006, Donaldson did not own or live on the subject property. Nor did he own or live on the subject property at any time when 57 O.S., § 590 was subsequently amended through the most recent amendment in 2019. Donaldson did not seek to live in the restricted area until 2021--sixteen years after his conviction and fifteen years after the Oklahoma Legislature amended the statute to prohibit sex offenders from living within a 2,000-foot radius of a park. Consequently, the Kentucky case, which found residency restrictions that expelled sex offenders from their homes even if they lived there prior to the statute's enactment were punitive, is not persuasive here.\", '¶34 Second, the residency restrictions in 57 O.S.Supp.2019, § 590(A) do not amount to banishment. The Tenth Circuit discussed the history of banishment at length in Shaw v. Patton, 823 F.3d 556, 566-568 (10th Cir. 2016). See also McGuire v. Marshall, 50 F.4th 986, 1008-09 (11th Cir. 2022). The cornerstones of banishment are the \"complete expulsion from a community\" and \"prohibiting offenders from even being present in the restricted area.\" Shaw, 823 F.3d at 567-68. With this deeper understanding of the historic punishment of banishment, we find that SORA\\'s residency restrictions do not amount to banishment. Section 590(A) does not expel sex offenders from entire communities or ban them from being present in city parks or playgrounds or visiting a home within the restricted area. The Starkey Court recognized as much when it noted that \"the offender is prohibited from residing on the property (ostensibly allowing a registered offender the ability to be at the residence, but not \"reside\" on the property).\" Starkey, 2013 OK 43, ¶ 60, 305 P.3d at 1026. As the City points out, 57 O.S., § 590(A) does not prohibit Donaldson from recreating or accessing the facilities at Lake El Reno. The statute only prevents him from establishing a residence in the restricted areas. Furthermore, Donaldson has not put forth any evidence that the scope of the residency restrictions would, effectively, prevent him from residing anywhere within the community of El Reno. We find that, upon closer inspection, this factor does not support a punitive effect.', '(3) Whether it is incumbent only on a finding of scienter', '¶35 Most, but not all, of the enumerated offenses triggering SORA require scienter. See 57 O.S., § 582; Starkey, 2013 OK 43, ¶ 62, 305 P.3d at 1026-27. This factor is given little weight and does not support a finding that the statute is punitive. See id.; Smith, 58 U.S. at 105.', '(4) Whether its operation promotes the traditional aims of punishment--\\nretribution and deterrence', '¶36 The Starkey opinion alludes to § 590 for a third and final time when the Court observes that SORA promotes deterrence through the threat of negative consequences, such as eviction and living restrictions. See Starkey, 2013 OK 43, ¶ 63, 305 P.3d at 1027. But the Court also warns that \"[m]erely because a statute may deter future crimes does not in and of itself impose a punishment.\" Id. (citing Smith, 538 U.S. at 102). We agree with this sentiment and several federal appellate courts which have found such an indirect promotion of deterrence does not weigh strongly in favor of a punitive effect. See Shaw, 823 F.3d at 571; Miller, 405 F.3d at 720; Hatton v. Bonner, 356 F.3d 955, 965 (9th Cir. 2004). After all, many civil laws deter crime without imposing punishment. See Smith, 538 U.S. at 102. \"To hold that the mere presence of a deterrent purpose renders such sanctions \\'criminal\\' . . . would severely undermine the Government\\'s ability to engage in effective regulation.\" Id. (quoting Hudson v. United States, 522 U.S. 93, 105 (1997)). We find any deterrent purpose is merely incidental. The purpose of the residency restrictions is not so much to deter the commission of the original sex offense that triggered SORA as it is to deter or, more accurately, prevent the sex offender from committing another sex offense in the future. It is the threat of being imprisoned (if caught and convicted) that is intended to deter the original sex crime--not restrictions on where you can live after being released.', '¶37 \"A statute is retributive if it is intended to express condemnation for a crime and to restore moral balance.\" Shaw, 823 F.3d at 571 (citing Graham v. Florida, 560 U.S. 48, 71 (2010)). Parroting Starkey and the Kentucky Supreme Court, Donaldson argues that, because the residency restrictions apply across the board without any consideration given to what danger a registrant poses to children, it begins to look like retribution for past crimes rather than a regulation intended to prevent future ones. See Starkey, 2013 OK 43, ¶¶ 65-67, 305 P.3d at 1027-28 (citing Baker, 295 S.W.2d at 444). Again, the Court\\'s conclusion in Starkey was that extending the number of years one is subject to all of SORA\\'s obligations--not just the residency restrictions--was retributive and weighed in favor of a punitive effect. While it is conceivable that the residency restrictions reflect some degree of societal condemnation, we agree with the Tenth Circuit that prohibiting sex offenders from living within 2,000 feet of certain locations where children are often present is not an expression of condemnation that is sufficiently clear or strong enough to negate the legislature\\'s non-punitive intent. See Shaw, 823 F.3d at 571.', '(5) Whether the behavior to which it applies is already a crime', '¶38 The residency restrictions--like all provisions of SORA--only apply to people convicted of certain crimes. See 57 O.S.Supp.2020, § 582. We recognized in Starkey \"the fact that SORA applies only to behavior that is already a crime supports the conclusion this Mendoza-Martinez factor has a punitive effect.\" Starkey, 2013 OK 43, ¶ 68, 305 P.3d at 1028. However, this factor should be given little weight. As the United States Supreme Court said \"[t]he regulatory scheme applies only to past conduct, which was, and is, a crime. This is a necessary beginning point, for recidivism is the statutory concern. The obligations the statute imposes are the responsibility of registration, a duty not predicated upon some present or repeated violation.\" Smith, 538 U.S. at 105. The Supreme Court of Iowa astutely observed:', 'In Interest of T.H., 913 N.W.2d 578, 594 (Iowa 2018).', '(6) Whether it has a rational connection to a nonpunitive purpose', '¶39 SORA\\'s rational connection to its nonpunitive regulatory purpose is \"a most significant factor\" in the intent-effects test. Smith, 538 U.S. at 102 (citing United States v. Ursery, 518 U.S. 267, 290 (1996)) (emphasis added). In Starkey, the Court said: \"The protection of its citizens is a basic obligation of state government. Our evaluation of the sixth Mendoza-Martinez factor concludes SORA does advance a non-punitive purpose of public safety.\" Starkey, 2013 OK 43, ¶ 69, 305 P.3d at 1028. As the Shaw court observed, the Oklahoma legislature\\'s strategy is to reduce sex offenders\\' temptations and opportunities to re-offend through residency restrictions. See Shaw, 823 F.3d at 574. Donaldson concedes that the residency restrictions have a rational connection to the provision\\'s non-punitive objectives of protecting the public by reducing recidivism. This factor weighs heavily in favor of a finding that the residency restriction\\'s effects are not punitive.', '(7) Whether it is excessive in relation to this purpose', \"¶40 Donaldson argues that because there is no individualized assessment of a sex offender's risk for re-offending or propensity for harming children, the residency restrictions are excessive. Donaldson points out that even sex offenders whose victims were adults are prohibited from living near certain areas where children congregate. Donaldson presses this argument despite the fact his victim was a child under the age of 14 and he was designated as an aggravated sex offender.\", '¶41 \"Our inquiry examines the means chosen to carry out this legitimate purpose and determine whether such means are excessive.\" Starkey, 2013 OK 43, ¶ 71, 305 P.3d at 1029. In Smith, the United States Supreme Court explained that \"[t]he excessiveness inquiry of our ex post facto jurisprudence is not an exercise in determining whether the legislature has made the best choice possible to address the problem it seeks to remedy. The question is whether the regulatory means chosen are reasonable in light of the nonpunitive objective.\" Id. ¶ 70, at 1028 (quoting Smith, 538 U.S. at 105) (emphasis added).', \"¶42 There is one class of sex offenders with respect to the residency requirements. The residency restrictions apply to all persons subject to SORA for as long as they are required to register. There are not different residency restrictions based on a person's risk level, status as an aggravated or habitual sex offender, or the age of the victim. Restricting sex offenders from residing near areas where children congregate may be excessive when applied to persons previously convicted of crimes against adults. However, the Oklahoma Legislature is permitted to make a reasonable categorical judgment that being convicted of certain crimes--even sex crimes against adults--poses some risk to minors. The majority in Smith said:\", 'Smith, 538 U.S. at 103-104. The Oklahoma Legislature made a policy decision that all persons convicted of the sexual offenses enumerated in 57 O.S., § 582 are at risk of re-offending and pose a threat to children. A categorical rule that restricts where sex offenders can live could reasonably further this nonpunitive purpose and is not excessive. See Shaw, 823 F.3d at 576-77; Miller, 405 F.3d at 721-22. As one court said, \"the residency restrictions of Jessica\\'s Law are not overbroad, and thus punitive, simply because they do not narrow the affected class to those registered sex offenders who are most likely to attack children.\" People v. Mosley, 344 P.3d 788, 804 (Cal. 2015). One must bear in mind that \"[a] statute is not deemed punitive simply because it lacks a close or perfect fit with the nonpunitive aims it seeks to advance.\" Smith, 538 U.S. at 103. It need only be reasonable in light of the nonpunitive objectives. See id. Prohibiting sex offenders from residing within 2,000 feet of a park to carry out the legitimate purpose of protecting the public, specifically, protecting children, is not so excessive it is unreasonable. This factor provides little support for punitive effect.', \"The punitive effects of the residency restrictions do not clearly outweigh \\nSORA's non-punitive purposes\", '¶43 Considering these factors, we conclude that Donaldson has not presented clear proof that the punitive effects of the residency restriction negates the civil, regulatory purposes of preventing sex offenders from re-offending and protecting the public, specifically children. A law that restricts sex offenders from residing near places where children congregate, such as a park, furthers these non-punitive purposes. The only factor with significant weight in support of punitive effect is that any limitation on where a person may live imposes an affirmative disability or restraint. However, this factor alone does not transform a civil regulation into criminal punishment.', '¶44 We hold that prohibiting sex offenders from residing within a 2,000-foot radius of a city park does not impose or increase punishment.18 Therefore, the Oklahoma Constitution\\'s ex post facto clause is not implicated, and the Legislature may give retroactive effect to 57 O.S., § 590(A). The current residency restrictions apply to \"any person registered pursuant to the Sex Offenders Registration Act.\" 57 O.S.Supp.2019, § 590(A). This includes persons who became subject to SORA prior to the enactment or amendment of the residency restrictions. All sex offenders must comply with the residency restrictions in the current version of 57 O.S., § 590(A), regardless of when they became subject to the provisions of SORA. The Court of Civil Appeals\\'s decision in Graham v. Carrington Place Property Owners Ass\\'n, 2019 OK CIV APP 33, 456 P.3d 1137, is expressly overruled.', '¶45 This case does not present facts where a registered sex offender lives in an unrestricted area at the time a law is enacted or amended that prohibits the sex offender from living in the area within which his residence is located. Nor is Donaldson challenging the constitutionality of 57 O.S.Supp.2007, § 583(I), which provides: \"The duty to register as a sex offender in this state shall not be prevented if, at the time of registration, it is determined that the person owns or leases a residence that is located within a restricted area provided for in Section 590 of this title.\" However, we recognize that there are likely some sex offenders who are not in compliance with the current residency restrictions and will need to move. Whether 57 O.S., § 590(A) should contain a grandfather clause providing that the residency restrictions do not apply if the sex offender\\'s residency predates the enactment or amendment of the law is a policy decision for the Oklahoma Legislature.19', 'VII. United States Constitution', \"¶46 We also reverse the trial court's conclusion that the retroactive application of 57 O.S.Supp.2019, § 590(A) to Donaldson violates Article 1, § 10 of the United States Constitution. The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals addressed this issue in Shaw v. Patton, 823 F.3d 556 (10th Cir. 2016), and held that the residency restrictions20 did not constitute retroactive punishment in violation of the ex post facto clause of the United States Constitution. See id. at 559-60. Shaw is persuasive. For the reasons stated in Shaw and by this Court in our analysis under the Oklahoma Constitution, we hold that applying the residency restrictions in 57 O.S.Supp.2019, § 590(A) to Donaldson does not violate the ex post facto clause of the United States Constitution.\", 'VIII. Whether Lake El Reno is a \"Park\" for Purposes of 57 O.S.Supp.2019, § 590(A)', '¶47 Because the trial court concluded that the 2019 residency restrictions could not be applied to Donaldson, it did not determine whether material facts, such as whether the subject property was located within a 2,000-foot radius of a city park, were in dispute. The trial court found the issues were moot. As a result of this Court\\'s holding, these issues are no longer moot. However, an appellate court does not make first-instance determinations of disputed issues of either law or fact in the exercise of our appellate jurisdiction. In re Guardianship of Stanfield, 2012 OK 8, ¶ 27, 276 P.3d 989, 1001. On remand, the trial court is to determine whether a dispute of material fact exists as to whether Lake El Reno is a \"park\" for purposes of 57 O.S.Supp.2019, § 590(A) and, if so, whether the subject property is located within a 2,000-foot radius of the property line of the park.', 'CONCLUSION', \"¶48 The law prohibiting registered sex offenders from residing within 2,000 feet of a city park, 57 O.S.Supp.2019, § 590(A), does not amount to punishment and applies retroactively to persons who became subject to the provisions of SORA prior to the law's enactment or amendment without violating the ex post facto clauses of the federal or state Constitution.\", 'ORDER OF THE DISTRICT COURT IS REVERSED\\nAND CAUSE REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS.', 'CONCUR: ROWE, C.J., GURICH, DARBY, KANE, JJ., and HUBER, S.J.', 'CONCUR IN PART, DISSENT IN PART: KUEHN, V.C.J.

See id., ¶¶ 28-32, at 1015-16. The Court noted that, because the Department of Corrections (DOC), regardless of legislative intent, had been applying the level assignments retroactively and because the legislative intent was to apply the 2004 amendments to 57 O.S., § 583 retroactively, it was incumbent to address whether or not these extensions to the registration period violated the prohibition of ex post facto laws. Id. ¶¶ 28, 35-36, at 1015, 1017-18.', '8 However, amendments to 57 O.S., § 590 are to be given only prospective effect in the sense that the amended residency restrictions apply to where sex offenders can live after the effective date. One cannot be found in violation of 57 O.S., § 590 for living within a newly restricted area for any time period prior to the effective date of the relevant residency restriction. A sex offender is in violation of § 590 only if he or she lives within a restricted area after the new legislation or amendment goes into effect. For example, a registered sex offender lived next door to a school from 1999 to 2001. During the entire time he lived next door to the school, nothing in SORA prohibited him from living there. Then, in 2003, the Legislature enacts 57 O.S., § 590, which prohibits registered sex offenders from living within a 2,000-foot radius of a school. Section 590 cannot be retroactively enforced against the sex offender for living in the newly-restricted area from 1999 to 2001. It was not a crime for a sex offender to live next door to a school during the time he lived there. This is a classic example of an ex post facto law. The ex post facto clause prohibits retroactively imposing punishment for an act that was not criminal at the time it was committed. See Collins v. Youngblood, 497 U.S. 37, 42-43 (1990).', '9 In Smith, the United States Supreme Court said:', 'Smith v. Doe, 538 U.S. 84, 105 (2003).', '10 The City stresses that the majority in Starkey rejected the clearest proof standard and adopted an alternative standard set forth in Justice Ginsburg\\'s dissent in Smith v. Doe. While the Starkey opinion does include some discussion of Justice Souter and Justice Ginsburg\\'s dissatisfaction with the clearest proof standard, this Court ultimately applied the clearest proof standard in Starkey. See Starkey, 2013 OK 43, ¶ 77, 305 P.3d at 1030 (\"We find there is clear proof that the effect of the retroactive application of SORA\\'s registration is punitive and outweighs its non-punitive purpose.\") (emphasis added).', \"11 In Smith, the United States Supreme Court applied the intent-effects test to Alaska's Sex Offender Registry Act. Prior to the passage of the Alaska Sex Offender Registry Act in 1994, the respondents had been convicted of sexual abuse of a minor, an aggravated sex offense under the Act. See Smith, 538 U.S. at 89-91. The Act required the respondents to register for life and verify their information quarterly. Id. at 91. The United States Supreme Court determined the Act was not punitive; therefore, requiring the respondents to register was not a retroactive punishment prohibited by the ex post facto clause of the United States Constitution. Id. at 105-06.\", \"We decline City and the Attorney General's invitation to revisit and overrule Starkey today. They assert that the Starkey Court wrongly deviated from the United States Supreme Court's decision in Smith v. Doe. Furthermore, they criticize the opinion for failing to provide an explanation of how the ex post facto clause in the Oklahoma Constitution provides greater protection than the ex post facto clauses in the United States Constitution and complain that Starkey has proven to be difficult to implement and enforce.\", \"12 The Court, in weighing the disabilities and restraints imposed on sex offenders, discussed in-person registration, public notification, and the publication of the registrant's personal information at length and only briefly mentioned restrictions on where and with whom sex offenders can live and work.

See 2013 OK 43, ¶ 43, 305 P.3d at 1020. The Court then moved on to the second step of the intent-effects test: whether SORA's effects are so punitive as to negate that civil, regulatory intent.\", '17 Our conclusion is contrary to the Tenth Circuit\\'s assessment in Shaw v. Patton, 823 F.3d 556 (10th Cir. 2016). The Tenth Circuit concluded: \"In our view, Oklahoma\\'s residency restrictions are not sufficiently harsh to constitute an affirmative disability or restraint that has a punitive effect.\" Id. at 571. The Shaw court focused on the burden or inconvenience of needing to verify that a prospective residence is not within 2,000 feet of a restricted area, not the disability or restraint imposed by limiting one\\'s housing options. See id. at 570. We do, however, agree with the Tenth Circuit that the additional effort necessary to ensure compliance with the law when relocating is minor and indirect. Id.', 'The Shaw court noted that 57 O.S., § 590 is less disabling than some other state laws, because it does not require a sex offender to move if a new child care center, child care home, or park is established within 2,000 feet of the sex offender\\'s residence. See 57 O.S.Supp.2008, § 590(A) (\"Establishment of a day care center or park in the vicinity of the residence of a registered sex offender will not require the relocation of the sex offender or the sale of the property.\"); Shaw, 823 F.3d at 570. The Shaw court further observed that there is no exception if the sex offender\\'s residency predates a newly established school, educational institution, property or campsite used by an organization whose primary purpose is working with children, playground, or his or her victim moves within 2,000 feet of the sex offender\\'s residence. The lack of exceptions for these new establishments is not before the Court today.', \"18 In concluding that the residency restrictions are not punitive, we join the majority of courts from other jurisdictions having assessed the constitutionality of similar residency restrictions. See, e.g., McGuire v. Marshall, 50 F.4th 986, 1008 (11th Cir. 2022) (Alabama law); Shaw, 823 F.3d at 577 (Oklahoma law); Weems v. Little Rock Police Dep't, 453 F.3d 1010, 1017 (8th Cir. 2006) (Arkansas law); Doe v. Miller, 405 F.3d 700, 720 (8th Cir.2005) (Iowa law); Hatton v.

Kester, 2013 WI App 50, ¶ 31, 830 N.W.2d 710, 721 (city ordinance); but see, e.g., State v. Pollard, 908 N.E.2d 1145, 1152 (Ind. 2009) (finding residency restrictions were punitive as applied to sex offender because he already owned and lived in the house when the law was enacted); Commonwealth v. Baker, 295 S.W.3d 437, 444 (Ky. 2009) (finding KRS 17.545, which forced sex offenders to move even if their residency predated the statute or establishment of a new school, day care, or playground, to be punitive).\", \"19 A 2005 opinion from the Attorney General of the State of Oklahoma suggests 57 O.S., § 590 may be applied retroactively to sex offenders who lived there before the law went into effect without violating the ex post facto clause. See Question Submitted by: Honorable Brian A. Crain, State Senator, District 39, 2005 OK AG 11(March 31, 2005)). That part of the Attorney General's opinion is consistent with today's holding that SORA's residency restrictions may be applied retroactively to persons who became subject to the provisions of SORA prior to the law's enactment or amendment without violating the ex post facto clauses of the federal or state Constitution.\", 'Furthermore, nothing in today\\'s Opinion affects a registered sex offender\\'s right to own property after the date of conviction or the enactment or amendment of a law, which prohibits a sex offender from residing in the area within which the subject property is located. Since the Legislature first enacted residency restrictions in 2003, the following statutory language has remained unchanged: \"Nothing in this provision shall require any person to sell or otherwise dispose of any real estate or home acquired or owned prior to the conviction of the person as a sex offender.\" Compare 57 O.S.Supp.2003, § 590 with 57 O.S.Supp.2019, § 590(A). Today\\'s decision merely concerns sex offenders residing on or occupying property located within a restricted area.', '20 Shaw concerned the 2009 version of the statute, which included a similar park restriction. See 57 O.S.Supp.2008, § 590(A).', '', '', 'KUEHN, V.C.J., CONCURRING IN PART and DISSENTING IN PART:', '¶1 I agree that Donaldson is subject to the current residency requirements of the Oklahoma Sex Offender Registration Act (SORA). 57 O.S.Supp.2019, § 590(A). However, I take a different path to reach that conclusion.', '¶2 The United States Supreme Court provides the framework for our SORA analysis. Smith v. Doe, 538 U.S. 84 (2003). First, we must determine whether the Legislature intended the statutory scheme to be civil or punitive in nature -- whether it was meant to impose punishment. Smith, 538 U.S. at 92. I believe that SORA is, on its face, a civil Act; its stated aim is to protect public safety and aid law enforcement. 57 O.S. § 581(B). That doesn\\'t end the inquiry; we must next determine whether the Act or any particular provision is so punitive in purpose or effect that it ceases to be civil. Id. Smith provided that only the \"clearest proof\" would \"transform...a civil remedy into a criminal penalty.\" Smith, 538 U.S. at 92.', \"¶3 In Starkey, this Court determined that a revised sex offender risk level assignment system, extending the registration period, was punitive and could not be retroactively applied. Starkey v. Oklahoma Department of Corrections, 2013 OK 43, ¶ 79, 305 P.3d 1104, 1030. The opinion was explicitly restricted to the risk level assignment issue. Id. However, Starkey's broad language has been read to suggest that SORA was punitive in its entirety; indeed that interpretation is argued by Donaldson and the dissent. Even the limited ruling in Starkey, and certainly its supposed broader application, make it an outlier. In Smith itself, the United States Supreme Court concluded that the Alaska sex offender registration act was not punitive and could be applied retroactively. Smith, 538 U.S. at 105-06. And while acknowledging Starkey, even the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals has found explicitly that sex offender registration is neither part of a range of criminal punishment nor a material consequence of sentencing and, thus, not a matter for jury consideration. Reed v. State, 2016 OK CR 10, ¶¶ 17-18, 373 P.3d 118, 123.\", '¶4 Starkey is unworkable and must be overturned. As this case shows, Starkey is taken both as a narrow ruling affecting only a single, isolated part of SORA and as a broad ruling barring any application of SORA retroactively. This is in large part because the Starkey language encourages both interpretations. The dissent suggests that Donaldson and the trial court were correct in applying Starkey broadly, while the Majority insists it is limited to its facts. Both these things cannot be true.', \"¶5 I cannot join the dissent. Justice Combs authored both Starkey and the dissent in this case. In dissent here he argues that Starkey focused on SORA's punitive effect (the second half of the SORA analysis) rather than its punitive intent. However, he rejects the Majority's suggestion that Starkey supports a conclusion that SORA is civil in nature and only punitive in effect. Justice Combs makes clear that, had the Starkey Majority analyzed the Legislature's intent, it would have concluded SORA was intended to be punitive. I cannot agree either that the SORA requirements here increase Donaldson's punishment, or that the Legislature intended SORA to be punitive in part or as a whole. After reviewing its language, history and effect I would find SORA is a civil statute in its entirety.\", \"¶6 But I cannot join the Majority either, because of how it handles Starkey. The first question in analyzing SORA is whether it is civil or punitive in intent. The Starkey parties wanted an answer to that question one way or the other, but this Court didn't give them one. Instead of following the United States Supreme Court's example in Smith, we refused to consider SORA as a whole. I believe we should have done so. If we find SORA is civil once, we don't have to find it again in every case. Going forward the burden will always be on the sex offender to show that a specific SORA provision is punitive as applied to him. That is, if we once find that SORA as a whole is civil, the presumption is that its provisions may always apply retroactively; only if a court finds that a provision is punitive in effect must it be applied prospectively. This would reduce the litigation surrounding SORA and simplify SORA claims. The Majority recognizes that Starkey itself limited its finding that SORA was punitive to the registration requirement -- that it refused to consider SORA as a whole. And then the Majority does the same thing. The Majority reviews only the residency requirement, leaving the rest for another day. So there is still no finality, no initial presumption that the SORA statutory provisions apply to every sex offender. Consequently, the State will have to prove that SORA is civil over and over again, in every case, before the sex offender must show a particular provision is punitive in effect.\", '¶7 Future trial and appellate courts will have to decide, for every SORA requirement and amendment the Legislature imposes, whether it was initially intended to be civil or criminal. I do not believe this piecemeal approach to the entirety of SORA helps anyone affected by it or represents a wise use of judicial resources. This will lead to more uncertainty for both trial courts and the sex offenders subject to SORA. Our simplest and most prudent course is to follow the example set by Smith and determine that SORA was intended to be a civil statute. The rights of all parties remain protected, because a court can still determine whether a particular requirement may be so punitive in effect that it cannot be applied retroactively. Thus, I would overrule Starkey insofar as it may hold that any portion of SORA is punitive.1', \"¶8 I do not reach this conclusion lightly. Normally, stare decisis would compel us to somehow reconcile the Starkey analysis and holding with other case law and the statutory provisions at issue here. The Majority attempts to do just that. But, particularly where constitutional rights are concerned, our focus must be not just on respecting precedent but also on making sure that the precedent is right; we must be willing to correct bad law. Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Org., 597 U.S. 215, 264 (2022). Mere disagreement is not enough; this requires more than a belief that the decision was wrong. Allen v. Cooper, 389 U.S. 248, 259 (2020). Justice Kavanaugh summarized the factors used by the United States Supreme Court when deciding whether to overturn a prior decision: (1) the quality of the precedent's reasoning; (2) its consistency and coherence with earlier or later decisions; (3) whether facts or law have changed since the prior decision; (4) whether it is still workable; (5) the reliance interests of those who have relied on the precedent; and (6) its age. Ramos v. Louisiana, 590 U.S. __, 140 S.Ct. 1390, 1414 (2020) (Kavanaugh, J., concurring in part). This Court, with different language, has broadly articulated very similar factors: (1) whether the rule is unworkable; (2) whether persons relying on it would be subject to hardship were it overruled; and (3) whether the law or facts have changed to the point that the old rule is abandoned, cannot be justified or applied. Rodgers v. Higgins, 1993 OK 45, ¶ 29, 871 P.2d 398, 412.\", \"¶9 Taken together these factors support my conclusion. First, age; this 2013 decision is too recent to have resulted in decades of reliance that would weigh against overturning the ruling. And second, consistency: while Starkey isn't long-standing, it is certainly inconsistent with decisions from other jurisdictions and Oklahoma.2 Most important for this factor is internal consistency. As I describe above, Starkey's reasoning is so uncertain that even this Court can't agree on what it says, much less what it means. As this case shows, lower courts have even less certainty. Because of this, the constituency which must effect the SORA statutory requirements -- law enforcement, courts, probation and parole officers, victims, and sex offenders themselves -- have been confused as to what provisions apply to whom, when, and what date must be used to determine that. No single section of the Starkey ruling clearly answers those questions, and the numerous amendments to SORA make them ever more difficult to answer under the Starkey formulation. Each individual case may need numerous calculations with different results based on each individual requirement.\", '¶10 If the Starkey process was ever workable, it isn\\'t now, on either an individual or systemwide level. What a sex offender must do may, in practice, depend on how courts and law enforcement in his county interpret SORA in light of Starkey. Multiply this by each registered sex offender, over time, and the system is unworkable. Sex offenders and law enforcement have been constrained to follow Starkey for the past twelve years but given the confusion the decision has caused one cannot say they relied on it. An overarching decision that SORA is a civil statute would clarify the law and simplify the process, benefiting all the stakeholders. Overruling Starkey would allow courts to give effect to every Legislative provision -- for instance, some are given retroactive effect while others are not -- and provide a framework that would serve interested parties better than the uncertainty surrounding Starkey. They would be helped, not subject to hardship, should this rule be abandoned. The full Latin phrase is \"stare decisis et non quieta movere -- stand by the thing decided and do not disturb the calm. . . .\" James C. Rehnquist, Note, The Power That Shall be Vested in a Precedent: Stare Decisis, the Constitution, and the Supreme Court, 66 B.U. L. Rev., 345, 347 (1986). Starkey has brought a decade of confusion, not calm, and I would no longer stand by its decision that SORA, or any portion of it, is punitive in intent.', '¶11 Because I find that SORA is civil in nature, I would narrow our analysis to the requirement before us: is the residency requirement in Section 590(A) so punitive in effect that it cannot be applied retroactively to Donaldson? If not, then the overall civil nature of the statute controls and it applies to him.', '¶12 The Supreme Court set out the appropriate review using seven factors:', 'Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U.S. 144, 168-69 (1963).', \"¶13 I believe the record is inadequate to show by the clearest proof that Section 590(A) is punitive in effect. I agree with the Majority that based on common sense and ordinary principles of statutory interpretation, the factors looking at scienter, deterrence, and already criminalized behavior do not support a finding of punitive effect. But other factors are more difficult to evaluate. Because Donaldson chose to immediately file for summary judgment, and the trial court made its decision based on that motion, there was no factual record compiled below. Without facts, we cannot fully apply the factors. For instance, on its face, Section 590(A) allows Donaldson freedom of movement throughout the state. But given the scope of the statute's residency prohibitions, does it effectively banish him from living in El Reno? We don't know. We have no evidence to consider. Looking at other factors, do the Section 590(A) residency restrictions advance the purpose of public safety, and are they excessive, as applied, related to that purpose? Other jurisdictions have answered those questions for their statutes based on facts particular to those cases. But those decisions can be persuasive only insofar as they compare to the facts and application of Oklahoma's statute. There's no evidence we can use to make that comparison.\", \"¶14 I would find that SORA is a civil statute and overrule Starkey. Applying the clearest proof standard, I would further find that, on the record in this case, the residency requirements of Section 590(A) are not so punitive in effect that they cannot be applied retroactively. Donaldson is subject to the residency requirements. For this reason I agree with the Majority's conclusion that the trial court's decision must be reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings.\", 'FOOTNOTES', \"1 While I appreciate Justice Combs' explanation that Starkey held the registration requirement was punitive in effect, not intent, that distinction does not change my analysis. I disagree with either or both findings. I would, however, leave undisturbed the results of prior cases decided in reliance on Starkey and my ruling would be prospective only.\", '2 See, e.g., Reed v. State, 2016 OK CR 10, 373 P.3d 118; People ex rel. Rivera v. Superintendent, Woodbourne Corr. Facility, 221 N.E.3d 1, 7 (N.Y. 2023); State v. Eighth Jud. Dist. Ct.

The Tenth Circuit declined to follow Starkey in determining that reporting and residency restrictions were civil rather than punitive; that Court noted that Starkey was decided on Oklahoma constitutional grounds and that this Court \"disavowed\" any obligation to follow federal precedent, including Smith.

When Mr. Donaldson was convicted by guilty plea on April 20, 2005, § 590 of Oklahoma\\'s Sex Offender Registration Act (SORA) restricted him only from \"resid[ing] within a two thousand-foot radius of any public or private school site or educational institution.\" See 57 O.S.Supp.2004, § 590 (amended 2006) (emphasis added). Nevertheless, the City of El Reno wishes to enforce against Mr. Donaldson the current version of § 590 enacted fourteen years later (i.e., in 2019), which adds restrictions to prevent him from \"resid[ing], either temporarily or permanently, within a two-thousand-foot radius of any . . . property or campsite used by an organization whose primary purpose is working with children, a playground or park that is established, operated or supported in whole or in part by a homeowners\\' association or a city, town, county, state, federal or tribal government, a licensed child care center or family child care home as defined in the Oklahoma Child Care Facilities Licensing Act or the residence of his or her victim,\" 57 O.S.2021, § 590(A).

These additional residency restrictions serve to retroactively increase the punishment for Mr. Donaldson\\'s 2005 conviction in violation of the ex post facto clause in Article II, § 15 of the Oklahoma Constitution. The trial court correctly determined \"that the version [of § 590] in effect at the time of Plaintiff\\'s conviction controls his registration requirements\" and that \"[a]pplying the November 1, 2019 version of 57 O.S. Supp. 2019 § 590 would be a retroactive application . . . of such a punitive nature\" as to \"violate the ban on ex post factor [sic] laws in Article 2, § 15 of the Oklahoma Constitution.\" ROAA, Doc. 11, Journal Entry of J. ¶¶ 2, 4, at 1--2. This Court should therefore affirm the trial court\\'s summary judgment.', '¶2 I reach this conclusion because I disagree with the majority on three major points in their application of the \"intent-effects\" test that this Court adopted in Starkey v. Oklahoma Department of Corrections, 2013 OK 43, ¶ 41, 305 P.3d 1004, 1019. First, I take issue with the majority\\'s finding that \"the legislative intent of SORA is not to punish.\" Majority Op. ¶ 28. Second, I object to the majority\\'s adoption and application of the \"clearest proof\" burden in weighing whether the seven Mendoza-Martinez1 factors demonstrate the punitive effects of the statute. See id. ¶¶ 19, 37, 43 & n.10. Third, I disagree with the majority\\'s conclusion that the seven Mendoza-Martinez factors fail to demonstrate that the overall effects of the statute are so punitive as to negate any legislative intent to create a civil regulatory scheme. See id. ¶¶ 43--44.', '¶3 The first prong of the \"intent-effects\" test requires us to analyze whether the Oklahoma Legislature expressed an \"intent to make SORA and/or its amendments punitive.\" Starkey, 2013 OK 43, ¶ 41, 305 P.3d at 1019. It is an established \"principle that determining the civil or punitive nature of an Act must begin with reference to its text and legislative history.\" Seling v. Young, 531 U.S. 250, 262 (2001) (citing Hudson v. United States, 522 U.S. 93 (1997)); accord In re W.M., 851 A.2d 431, 441 (D.C. 2004) (citing Seling); State v. Langdon, 472 P.3d 31, 36 (Haw. Ct. App. 2020) (quoting Citizens Against Reckless Dev. v. Zoning Bd. of Appeals, 159 P.3d 143, 152 (Haw. 2007)); State v. Meredith, 399 P.3d 859, 863 (Kan. 2017) (looking at text and legislative history); State v. Burr, 1999 ND 143, ¶ 13, 598 N.W.2d 147, 153 (same); State v.

We look at the text of the legislative enactment and its overall structure to ascertain whether \"the legislature indicate[d] a preference either expressly or impliedly for a civil label or a criminal label.\" Starkey, 2013 OK 43, ¶ 41, 305 P.3d at 1019 (citing United States v. Ward, 338 U.S. 242, 248 (1980)). That said, simply labeling a law as \"civil\" or \"procedural\" will not immunize it from scrutiny under the ex post facto clauses because subtle violations are no more permissible than overt ones. Id. ¶ 41, 305 P.3d at 1019--20 (citing Collins v. Youngblood, 497 U.S. 37, 46 (1990)). Secondarily, this Court also takes note of other formal attributes of the legislative enactment such as the manner of its codification within a certain statutory title and the enforcement procedures it establishes. See Smith v. Doe, 238 U.S. 84, 92, 94 (2003).', '¶4 Nothing in Starkey answered this initial inquiry of the \"intent-effects\" test. The reason we didn\\'t address this first prong is because of our conclusion that \"[t]he second part of the test, whether SORA\\'s effects are punitive, is dispositive.\" Starkey, 2013 OK 43, ¶ 43, 305 P.3d at 1020 (emphasis added). We therefore specifically reserved judgment on the issue: \"Even if we assume the act as amended was intended to be a civil regulatory scheme[,] that fact does not dispose of the issue.\" Id. (emphasis added). Such assumptions are not out of the ordinary, but are regularly employed by courts utilizing the intent-effects test. E.g., Shaw v. Patton, 823 F.3d 556, 562 (10th Cir. 2016) (\"We ordinarily start with the legislature\\'s stated intent. But Mr. Shaw has not argued that the Oklahoma legislature\\'s stated intent is punitive. See Appellant\\'s Opening Br. at 20 (\"In the present case, Mr. Shaw has not attempted to prove that [the Oklahoma statute\\'s] stated legislative intention was punitive, due to ambivalent evidence.\"). Thus, we express no view on the Oklahoma legislature\\'s intent in enacting the sex-offender requirements.\" (emphasis added)); Doe v. State, 189 P.3d 999, 1007 (Alaska 2008) (\"It is not necessary to address the first step of the test--whether the legislature intended [the] A[laska ]SORA to punish convicted sex offenders--because the second part of the test--whether ASORA\\'s effects are punitive--resolves the dispute before us. Assuming without deciding that the legislature intended ASORA to be non-punitive, we therefore focus on the statute\\'s effects to determine whether they are punitive.\" (footnotes omitted) (emphasis added)).', '¶5 Nevertheless, the majority has selected statements from Starkey favoring its conclusion that \"the legislative intent of SORA is not to punish\" while ignoring other statements from Starkey disfavoring that conclusion. For instance, the majority asserts: \"In Starkey, this Court recognized \\'[t]he non-punitive objective revealed in § 581 is to protect the public from sex offenders re-offending after release from custody.\\'\" Majority Op. ¶ 28 (quoting Starkey, 2013 OK 43, ¶ 70, 305 P.3d at 1028). Similarly, the majority asserts that Starkey\\'s \"analysis in step one is somewhat ambivalent\" but that \"the Starkey Court ultimately determined SORA was intended to be a civil, regulatory scheme to help prevent sex offenders from re-offending.\" Id. ¶ 28 n.16 (citing Starkey, 2013 OK 43, ¶ 43, 305 P.3d at 1020).', '¶6 All these references seem to suggest that Starkey reached a result that, in actuality, it never did. Just read the entire paragraph cited by the majority for yourself:', 'Starkey, 2013 OK 43, ¶ 43, 305 P.3d at 1020 (footnote citation omitted). As this language demonstrates, the Starkey Court did not characterize the \"system to help prevent sex offenders from re-offending\" as a \"civil, regulatory scheme.\" Instead, relying upon Justice Souter\\'s separate writing from Smith v. Doe, the Starkey Court observed that a finding of civil intent ordinarily depends heavily upon the existence of an explicit label that the law is \"civil\" or \"regulatory\"--something that was lacking in § 581 of SORA.2 See id. Justice Souter\\'s separate writing from Smith rightly determined that, although \"[t]hese formal facts do not force a criminal characterization, . . . they stand in the way of asserting that the statute\\'s intended character is clearly civil.\" Smith, 238 U.S. at 108 (Souter, J., concurring in judgment) (emphasis added). That\\'s why the Starkey Court concluded in the very next paragraph that \"there is no clear legislative categorization that SORA is a civil law\" and why any determination of legislative intent was abandoned in favor of deciding the appeal based solely on the second prong. Starkey, 2013 OK 43, ¶¶ 43--44, 305 P.3d at 1020. Although certainly not authoritative, one student\\'s case note in the Oklahoma Law Review read Starkey this way, observing \"[t]he court determined that the Oklahoma legislature\\'s intent in enacting the original registration act was unclear\" and \"the court concluded the legislative intent was not clearly established.\" Alex Duncan, Note, Calling a Spade a Spade: Understanding Sex Offender Registration as Punishment and Implications Post-Starkey, 67 Okla. L. Rev. 323, 341 (2015). But today\\'s majority ignores Starkey\\'s endorsement of Justice Souter\\'s wise counsel, recharacterizes Starkey\\'s conclusion on this first prong, and proceeds to conclude without much analysis that the residency restrictions \"prohibit[ing] sex offenders from living near areas where children congregate[] are part of the civil, regulatory system intended to reduce recidivism and protect the public, specifically children.\" Majority Op. ¶ 28.', '¶7 A better analysis of legislative intent would include a discussion of the history of sex offender legislation in Oklahoma. Oklahoma\\'s sex offender registration scheme has been codified in various titles of the Oklahoma Statutes; it has not been confined to the provisions we refer to as SORA (i.e., 57 O.S.2021, §§ 581--590.2) or even to the title that contains SORA (i.e., Title 57). In fact, since the beginning SORA has been contained in more than one statutory title. See Sex Offenders Registration Act (SORA), ch. 212, §§1--7, 1989 Okla. Sess. Laws 556, 556--58 (codified at 57 O.S.Supp.1989, §§ 581--587); id. § 8, 1989 Okla. Sess. Laws at 558--59 (codified at 51 O.S.Supp.1989, § 24A.8). Provisions governing the day-to-day lives of registered sex offenders are found in Title 57, which governs \"Prisons & Reformatories\"; in Title 51, which governs \"Officers\"; in Title 21, which governs \"Crimes & Punishment\"; in Title 10, which governs \"Children\"; in Title 47, which governs \"Motor Vehicles\"; in Title 63, which governs \"Public Health\"; and in Title 70, which governs \"Schools.\" By taking a more holistic view of Oklahoma\\'s sex offender registration scheme and by refusing to limit our review to the specific provision(s) at issue in any given lawsuit (e.g., the 3-tier risk level assignment system that was at issue in Starkey or the residency restrictions at issue in Mr. Donaldson\\'s case), we can better assess both (1) whether the Oklahoma Legislature intended for Oklahoma\\'s sex offender registration scheme to be punitive or civil and (2) whether the effects of the specific provisions challenged by Mr. Donaldson, in particular, and of Oklahoma\\'s sex offender registration scheme, in general, are so punitive as to negate any intention to deem them civil. This holistic approach is more in tune with the Starkey Court\\'s consideration of \"SORA\\'s various requirements--including residency restrictions--and their cumulative effects [in] determin[ing] if [the specific provisions at issue in the case] w[ere] punitive.\" Majority Op. ¶ 23; see also id. ¶ 21 (emphasizing that \"[t]he Starkey Court determined that the cumulative effects of SORA\\'s requirements and restrictions were punitive\" (citing Starkey, 2013 OK 43, ¶ 77, 305 P.3d at 1030)). Thus, I will now engage in a review of Oklahoma legislation concerning sex offender registration.', \"¶8 SORA was originally enacted on May 9, 1989, when Governor Henry Bellmon signed House Bill 1136 into law.3 At that point, Oklahoma was the tenth State in the nation to enact such a law.4 SORA's title described the act as follows:\", 'AN ACT RELATING TO PRISONS AND REFORMATORIES; ESTABLISHING THE SEX OFFENDERS REGISTRATION ACT; PROVIDING SHORT TITLE; REQUIRING THE REGISTRATION OF CERTAIN PERSONS; PROVIDING FORM OF REGISTRATION; PROVIDING FOR MAINTENANCE OF REGISTRATION FILE; RESTRICTING ACCESS TO FILE INFORMATION; REQUIRING CERTAIN NOTIFICATION; PROHIBITING CERTAIN ACTS AND PROVIDING PENALTIES THEREFOR; AMENDING SECTION 8, CHAPTER 255, O.S.L. 1985 (51 O.S. SUPP. 1988, SECTION 24A.8), WHICH RELATES TO THE OKLAHOMA OPEN RECORDS ACT; PROVIDING THAT CERTAIN FILES SHALL NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC INSPECTION; PROVIDING FOR CODIFICATION; PROVIDING FOR SEVERABILITY; AND PROVIDING AN EFFECTIVE DATE.5', 'Section 1 of H.B. 1136 gave SORA its name.6 Section 2 specified that SORA applied to \"any person who, after November 1, 1989, has been convicted of, or received a suspended sentence for\" the commission or attempted commission of certain sex crimes, as well as to anyone \"who enters this state after November 1, 1989, and who has been convicted or received a suspended sentence for\" the commission or attempted commission of the same sex crimes.7 Section 3 required such a person to register with the Oklahoma Department of Corrections (DOC) within ten (10) days of a suspended sentence or a conviction for which there would be no incarceration, or within ten (10) days of release from incarceration, or within thirty (30) days of moving into Oklahoma from another jurisdiction; section 3 also imposed a duty upon the offender to maintain registration for a period of ten (10) years unless he or she successfully completed a sex offender treatment program offered by the DOC, in which case the registration period was only two (2) years.8 Section 4 required the DOC to approve a registration form containing certain specified fields of information and to maintain a file that would \"be made available to state, county and municipal law enforcement agencies\" but would \"not be made available for public inspection\"; section 4 also imposed a duty upon registered offenders to provide notice of an address change within 10 business days.9 Section 5 required the sentencing judge and the releasing correctional facility to inform Oklahoma offenders of their duty to register, and it required the Department of Public Safety to issue written notification to out-of-state applicants for driver licenses about sex offender registration requirements.10 Section 6 forbade the provision of false or misleading information during registration under SORA.11 Under section 7, the violation of any provision of SORA was deemed a misdemeanor punishable by incarceration for not more than one (1) year, a fine of not more than $1,000.00, or both such fine and imprisonment.12 Finally, section 8 of SORA amended § 24A.8 of the Oklahoma Open Records Act to specify that \"[r]egistration files maintained by the Department of Corrections pursuant to the provisions of the Sex Offenders Registration Act shall not be made available for public inspection.\"13 All but one of SORA\\'s provisions were codified in Title 57 of the Oklahoma Statutes pertaining to \"Prisons & Reformatories\"; the remaining provision was codified with the Open Records Act in Title 51 pertaining to \"Officers.\" In its original enactment, none of SORA was codified in Title 21 pertaining to \"Crimes & Punishments.\"', '¶9 During that same session, Oklahoma legislators created a sex offender treatment program. Going into session, officials at the DOC requested $500,000 to implement a proposed psychological treatment \"program developed in Oregon that use[d] aversion therapy--electrical shocks and ammonia vapors--to discourage deviant fantasies.\"14 Representative Jeff Hamilton of Midwest City, who had also authored SORA, and Senator Dave Herbert of Midwest City introduced and passed House Joint Resolution 1004, which directed the DOC to create the Sexual Offender Treatment Program for sex offenders in prison.15 In conjunction with that measure, the Legislature also appropriated \"the sum of Three Hundred Eighty Thousand Dollars ($380,000.00) or so much thereof as may be necessary to promulgate the sex offender treatment program and to expend for other operating expenses of the Department of Corrections.\"16 By September 1, 1989, the DOC had hired a local psychologist to direct its program.17 By all accounts, it appears the program was up and running by November 1, 1989.18 Although the new director \"had some concerns about\" aversion therapy \"mainly because it doesn\\'t transfer to the real world,\" DOC officials reportedly adopted a program that included aversion therapy, group therapy, and \"chemical therapy that can reduce sex drive.\"19', \"¶10 In 1994, Congress had passed the Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act in the wake of the high-profile abduction of the bill's eleven-year-old namesake in Minnesota in late 1989.20 The Wetterling Act conditioned each State's receipt of federal grant funds for law enforcement assistance on that State's adoption of established guidelines for state sex offender registration programs.21 In particular, the Wetterling Act mandated registration with local law enforcement agencies.22\", '¶11 In light of the Wetterling Act, the Oklahoma Legislature needed to revamp SORA to require registration with local law enforcement agencies instead of, or in addition to, the DOC. In House Bill 1207, lawmakers amended SORA to require registration both with DOC for ten (10) years and \"[w]ith the local law enforcement authority having jurisdiction in the area where the person resides or intends to reside for more than seven (7) days\" for five (5) years.23 But lawmakers also took the opportunity to amend SORA so that local law enforcement agencies were required to \"make [their] sex offender registr[ies] available\" to \"all public and private elementary schools within the jurisdiction; . . . all childcare facilities licensed by the state within the jurisdiction; . . . any state agency that licenses individuals to work with children; . . . the State Office of Personnel Management to screen persons who may work with children; and . . . other entities that provide services to children and request the registry.\"24 Senator Jerry Smith of Tulsa, an author of the bill, explained that H.B. 1207 \"lets the community find out when a convicted child molester or rapist has moved into their area.\"25', '¶12 But H.B. 1207 went one step further than amending SORA. It also amended § 404.1 of the Oklahoma Child Care Facilities Licensing Act to make it unlawful for any sex offenders \"to work with or provide services to children and for any employer who offers or provides services to children to knowingly and willfully employ or allow continued employment of\" a sex offender, with violations subjecting both the sex offender and the daycare facility to a civil fine of $1,000 and civil liability in court.26 This provision was codified in Title 10 of the Oklahoma Statutes pertaining to \"Children.\" This 1995 bill marked the first time the Oklahoma Legislature restricted sex offenders\\' non-criminal activities.', '¶13 Two years later, the Oklahoma Legislature further amended SORA after another high-profile sex crime and related federal legislation. In Hamilton Township, New Jersey, seven-year-old Megan Kanka had been abducted, raped, and murdered in 1994 by her neighbor who had two prior convictions for sex crimes against young children.27 Megan\\'s parents asserted she would still be alive had New Jersey maintained a sex offender registry and notified them about their neighbor\\'s lurid past, leading them to lobby for such laws across the country.28 Their efforts led Congress to enact Megan\\'s Law in 1996, which amended the Wetterling Act to strike language deeming \"information collected under a State registration program\" as \"private\" and to add language permitting States to \"disclose[] for any purpose permitted under the laws of the State\" such information.29', '¶14 Oklahoma lawmakers followed suit shortly thereafter on May 27, 1997, passing several amendments to SORA in House Bill 1729.30 H.B. 1729 amended', '§ 581 of SORA to add a \"findings\" subsection:', 'H.B. 1729 also amended § 584 of SORA to implement the notification requirements in Megan\\'s Law. The DOC could promulgate rules to make information contained in its registry \"available for public inspection.\"32 Moreover, if the registrant qualified as a \"predatory sex offender\" as defined in the amendment, a local law enforcement agency would be required to send a detailed notification--i.e., a notice containing the predatory sex offender\\'s name, address, physical description, vehicle description, conditions and restrictions upon his probation, a description of his primary and secondary targets to victimize, a description of his method of offense, a current photograph, and the contact information for his probation officer--to \"anyone that the local law enforcement authority determines appropriate, including, but not limited to: a. the family of the predatory sex offender, b. any prior victim of the predatory sex offender, and c. residential neighbors and churches, community parks, schools, convenience stores, businesses and other places that children or other potential victims may frequent.\"33 The author of H.B. 1729, Representative Bill Paulk of Oklahoma City, told newspapers that sex offenders\\' privacy rights \"have to give way for the good of the many, in this case, for the good of our children.\"34', '¶15 But H.B. 1729 went farther than Megan\\'s Law. It amended § 582 of SORA to include new crimes that would serve as the basis for sex offender registration--including some crimes against children that did not entail sexual misconduct at all.35 H.B. 1729 also amended § 583 of SORA to shorten the deadlines for initial registration, to remove the incentive of a shorter registration period for sex offenders who successfully complete the sex offender treatment program, and to require notification of address changes so many days \"before the offender establishes residence\"36--a provision that seemingly conflicted with § 584(D) of SORA that required notification of address changes within so many days \"after the change of address.\"37 Section 584 of SORA was also amended to require the DOC to conduct annual address verifications of all registered sex offenders.38 H.B. 1729 also amended § 587 of SORA to increase the penalty for violating SORA from a misdemeanor to a felony punishable by incarceration up to five (5) years, a fine of up to $5,000, or both such fine and imprisonment.39', '¶16 But like its 1995 predecessor, H.B. 1729 went farther than just amending SORA. Yet again § 404.1 of the Oklahoma Child Care Facilities Licensing Act was amended to impose criminal liability on top of the existing civil fine and civil liability; thenceforth, going to work as a sex offender for a childcare facility would constitute a felony punishable by incarceration up to five (5) years, a fine of up to $5,000, or both such fine and imprisonment.40', '¶17 During that same session, Oklahoma legislators enacted House Bill 1927, part of which significantly impacted sex offenders and their families. The first section of that bill amended the statute governing the preference order for child custody and guardianship.41 The amendment required the trial court to \"determine whether any individual seeking custody of, guardianship of or visitation with a child is or has been subject to the registration requirements of the Oklahoma Sex Offenders Registration Act or any similar act in any other state\" and then created \"a rebuttable presumption that it is not in the best interests of the child to have custody, guardianship or unsupervised visitation granted\" to such a person.42 The rebuttable presumption applied regardless of what the underlying offense involved; it applied the same to drunks caught urinating in public as it did to child molesters. H.B. 1927 did not specify how the presumption could be overcome or what factors might militate against using the presumption.', '¶18 The very next year, the Oklahoma Legislature amended SORA again. House Bill 3144 amended § 584 of SORA to relabel \"predatory\" sex offenders as \"habitual\" sex offenders and to impose lifetime registration upon such habitual offenders.43 Section 584 of SORA was also amended to require the DOC to notify the local sheriff and DA about any sex offender whose address could not be verified during the annual audit.44', '¶19 That same session, Oklahoma legislators enacted Senate Bill 1394 to prevent sex offenders from working on school premises. S.B. 1394 enacted a new provision of law in SORA, § 589, which made it \"unlawful for any person registered pursuant to the Sex Offenders Registration Act to work with or provide services to children or to work on school premises\" and for anyone to employ a registered sex offender for purposes of providing services to children or performing work on school premises.45 A violation would subject both the sex offender and the employer to a civil fine of $1,000 and civil liability in court.46 S.B. 1394 also amended various provisions in Title 70 concerning \"Schools\" to require the dismissal or non-renewal of employment of any registered sex offenders serving as school administrators, teachers, or school support staff.47 This 1998 bill marked the second time the Oklahoma Legislature restricted sex offenders\\' employment opportunities.', '¶21 Leading up to the 2003 session, local newspapers reported on a sex offender who lived across the street from Pleasant Hill Elementary School in the Mid-Del School District.52 Under SORA\\'s notification provisions adopted in the wake of Megan\\'s Law, the local police chief notified the school principal, who in turn notified more than half of the students\\' parents.53 The newspaper article caught the eye of Representative Kevin Cox of Oklahoma City and led him to author House Bill 1501,54 which as introduced would have prohibited registered sex offenders from \"resid[ing] within one (1) mile of any public or private school site or educational institution.\"55 Days later, Senator Jonathan Nichols of Norman introduced Senate Bill 554, which created a \"zone of safety\" around elementary and junior high schools, day care centers, and playgrounds.56 Rep. Cox and Sen. Nichols subsequently joined forces and got their bills passed.57', '¶22 The title of Rep. Cox\\'s H.B. 1501 was \"An Act relating to the Sex Offenders Registration Act; restricting residency of persons required to register, providing an exception; providing penalty; providing for codification; and providing an effective date.\"58 The enacted version made it unlawful for a registered sex offender to reside within a 2,000-foot radius of any school.59 The \"exception\" referenced in the title said \"[n]othing in this provision shall require any person to sell or otherwise dispose of any real estate or home acquired or owned prior to the conviction of the person as a sex offender,\" but this language failed to specify whether the person would or would not be permitted to reside in the home.60 Under H.B. 1501, a first-time violation of the residency restriction would be a misdemeanor offense punishable by a fine of no more than $3,000, and any subsequent violation would be a misdemeanor offense punishable by incarceration for one year in addition to such fine.61 H.B. 1501 was codified in Title 57 as a new section under SORA.', '¶23 The title of Sen. Nichols\\'s S.B. 554 was \"An Act relating to crimes and punishments; creating certain safety zone against certain offenders on certain property; stating distance for safety zone property; providing penalties for violation; excepting certain offenders from safety zone for certain purpose; constructing certain provision; providing exception to prosecution as habitual offender; providing for codification; and declaring an emergency.\"62 S.B. 554 created a 300-foot safety zone around elementary and junior high schools, daycares, and playgrounds for sex offenders who committed certain sex crimes and whose victim was under the age of 13.63 An exception to the rule was made where the sex offender (a) was the custodial parent or legal guardian of an enrolled student at the school or daycare and (b) was enrolling, delivering, or retrieving said student at the facility during normal hours or for sanctioned extracurricular activities.64 Under S.B. 554, a first-time violation would be a misdemeanor offense punishable by a fine of no more than $2,500, and a subsequent violation would be a felony offense.65 S.B. 554 was codified in Title 21 of the Oklahoma Statutes pertaining to \"Crimes & Punishments.\"', '¶24 Legislation affecting sex offenders continued to be a perennial favorite. In 2004, Oklahoma lawmakers passed Senate Bill 1191 amending § 583 of SORA to expand the registration period for non-habitual and non-aggravated offenders to \"ten (10) years from the date of completion of the sentence,\" which they defined as \"mean[ing] the day an offender completes all incarceration, probation and parole pertaining to the sentence\"66--effectively lengthening the registration period well beyond the start-date for registration tied to \"release . . . from a correctional institution\" that is specified earlier in the very same section of SORA.67 Following another high-profile sex crime in February 2005 in which nine-year-old Jessica Lunsford was kidnapped, raped, and murdered by a convicted sex offender living in her neighborhood in Homosassa, Florida,68 Oklahoma lawmakers passed Senate Bill 631 entitled \"Jessica Lunsford\\'s Law.\"69 It amended existing provisions in Titles 22 and 57 of the Oklahoma Statutes pertaining to \"Criminal Procedure\" and \"Prisons & Reformatories\" to require both electronic monitoring of any sex offender on parole or transitioning out of prison through a community work center or halfway house and electronic monitoring of all habitual and aggravated sex offenders for the duration of their lifetime registration through use of a global position monitoring device.70 Also in 2005, after a year-long campaign by an advocacy group,71 lawmakers passed House Bill 1963, which amended § 584 of SORA to require notification of nursing homes about certain registered sex offenders living in or around their facility,72 amended § 1-1909 of the Nursing Home Care Act to require nursing homes to post such notices,73 and enacted the Long-term Care Security Act requiring nursing homes to conduct background checks of employees, volunteers, and contractors.74', '¶25 Moving ahead to 2006, both chambers of the Legislature were busy with initiatives, agendas, and bills targeting sex offenders. In the House, four sex offender bills were introduced--i.e., House Bills 2381, 2569, 2830, and 2839--but none were passed. Concurrently in the Senate, seven sex offender bills were introduced--i.e., Senate Bills 1426, 1707, 1708, 1747 (eventually incorporated into 1800), 1754, 1755, and 1964--and four were enacted. To get the full picture of legislative intent concerning sex offenders, all the bills are discussed below.', '¶26 After a constituent notified Representative Lance Cargill of Harrah \"about the daily trauma her 14-year-old daughter was experiencing by having to attend the same school as her rapist, who was a minor-aged classmate,\" Rep. Cargill introduced H.B. 2381, which would prevent student-aged sex offenders from attending the same school or riding the same bus as their victim or their victim\\'s sibling(s).75 H.B. 2381 was referred to the House Committee on Common Education, which removed a provision that discussed the possibility of the student-aged sex offender not being able to find another school to reinforce the notion that the sex offender must find a different school.76 The House engrossed H.B. 2381 to the Senate.77 The Senate referred H.B. 2381 to the Senate Committee on Education, where the bill died.78 Despite Rep. Cargill\\'s failure to enact the policy in 2006, it would be enacted after he assumed the speakership in 2007.79', \"¶27 Representative Ryan Kiesel of Seminole introduced H.B. 2569, which would add new sections to SORA requiring sex offenders to be assessed and assigned a risk level to determine what degree of community notification was needed.80 H.B. 2569 was referred to the House Committee on Corrections and Criminal Justice, which made minor revisions to the bill; but the full House never engrossed the bill to the Senate.81 Despite Rep. Kiesel's failure to enact the policy in 2006, a risk-level assignment system for sex offenders would be enacted in 2007.82\", '¶28 \"The fight against sex offenders continue[d]\" with H.B. 2830, authored by Representative Lisa Billy of Purcell.83 In her press release, Rep. Billy disclosed that she was committed to \"take whatever measures necessary to wage the war against sex crimes.\"84 H.B. 2830 would require registered sex offenders to renew their driver licenses or ID cards each year instead of every four years, so as to provide local law enforcement agencies with more up-to-date addresses and photographs for the registry.85 H.B. 2830 was referred to the House Committee on Corrections and Criminal Justice, which amended the proposed bill to include a price reduction for annual renewals.86 The House then engrossed H.B. 2830 to the Senate, where the bill died in committee.87 The policy--albeit without the conciliatory price reduction--was eventually incorporated into one of the Senate\\'s surviving sex offender bills, S.B. 1964, and signed into law by Governor Brad Henry.88', '¶29 Speaker Todd Hiett of Kellyville introduced the \"Keeping Oklahoma Kids Safe\" initiative, which was touted as \"a key goal of the House Republican caucus of the 2006 legislative session.\"89 Of the initiative\\'s three planks, only the second plank is relevant here. Found in H.B. 2839 authored by Representative Susan Winchester of Chickasha, it \"focuse[d] on three areas of reform to crack down on sex offenders\": (a) it \"would prohibit registered sex offenders from living within 2,000 feet of parks and playgrounds,\" (b) \"strengthen punishments . . . . [and] narrow the range of penalties available in sex offender cases involving children,\" and (c) \"expand the current \\'two strikes\\' provision, which sentences repeat sex offenders to life without parole.\"90 Rep. Winchester believed her bill was needed \"to put these demented criminals behind bars and keep[] them there for as long as possible.\"91 Early on, Representative Randy Terrill of Moore expressed his desire, \"[w]ith Winchester\\'s consent, . . . to offer an amendment to [her] bill that would . . . prevent defense attorneys, district attorneys, and judges from entering into or approving plea agreements that exempt a criminal from sex-offender registration\" because he thought \"[r]apists must not be allowed to skirt the requirements of our sex offender registry.\"92 Rep. Terrill\\'s amendment was added to H.B. 2839 by committee substitute.93 H.B. 2839 cleared the House committee referrals and was engrossed to the Senate,94 but Senate Democrats let H.B. 2839 die in committee.95 But House Republicans weren\\'t ready to see the policies die with H.B. 2839.96', '¶30 Senator Brian Crain of Tulsa introduced S.B. 1426, which would require registered sex offenders to obtain new driver licenses bearing the words \"Sex Offender.\"97 Sen. Crain touted S.B. 1426 as \"another opportunity for us to protect the very young and very old here in Oklahoma\" by allowing vendors at nursing homes, day care centers, and schools to verify \"that individuals they are placing in those same facilities are not on the sex offender registry.\"98 After being kicked back and forth between the two chambers, S.B. 1426 was referred to a conference committee, where the bill died.99 Despite his failure to enact the policy in 2006, Sen. Crain would reintroduce and enact an identical measure during the 2007 legislative session--i.e., Senate Bill 35--in an effort \"to use every resource available to protect children from molesters and rapists.\"100', '¶31 As \"another step in the legislature\\'s fight to protect the public from sexual predators,\" Senator David Myers of Ponca City introduced S.B. 1707 to \"ensur[e] that more governmental agencies have access to the registry.\"101 S.B. 1707 amended § 584 of SORA both to make the sex offender registry available to the Oklahoma Commissioner of Health and to authorize the Commissioner to forward the registry to nursing homes and long-term care facilities.102 The Legislature unanimously passed S.B. 1707, and Governor Henry signed the bill into law on May 9, 2006.103', \"¶32 Senator Jonathan Nichols of Norman introduced S.B. 1708, which originally was intended to amend the residency restrictions in § 590 of SORA both to include daycare facilities and to expand the restricted radius from 2,000 feet to ½ mile.104 The measure was referred to the Senate Committee on Education, which removed the ½-mile radius from the bill.105 On the Senate floor, the measure was again amended to include a new provision prohibiting sex offenders from sharing a residence with their victim until the victim reached 18 years of age.106 Upon engrossment, House leadership--still reeling from the Senate's decision to kill H.B. 2839107--referred S.B. 1708 to the House Committee on Corrections and Criminal Justice for substantial alterations. The House's committee substitute incorporated H.B. 2839's provision that narrowed the range of penalties available in sex offender cases involving children, as well as numerous other irrelevant provisions.108 The bill died before going to the House floor for a vote,109 probably because both chambers began negotiating a compromise that coalesced into S.B. 1755 and S.B. 1964.110\", '¶33 Senator Jay Paul Gumm of Durant introduced S.B. 1747, which sought to add the death penalty as a punishment option for repeat sex offenders whose victims were minor children.111 After being engrossed to the House, S.B. 1747 was denied a hearing in the House Committee on Corrections and Criminal Justice.112 Sen. Gumm eventually tried incorporating his policy into another House bill, but the House eventually rejected those efforts in late April.113 The House attempted to put the death penalty provision in S.B. 1708, but that bill also died as discussed above.114 Ultimately, the death penalty provision would be incorporated into S.B. 1800 authored by Sen. Nichols of Norman--which otherwise concerned the creation of a Child Abuse Response Team (CART) within the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation (OSBI)--as a means to \"send[] a clear message to child predators in our state . . .

Winchester\\'s playgrounds and parks to the residency restrictions in § 590 of SORA,121 but also adding \"licensed daycare centers\" to the residency restrictions, specifying that \"[t]he distance indicated in this section shall be measured from the nearest property line\" of the sex offender\\'s residence \"to the nearest property line\" of the forbidden facility, and increasing the penalty for first-time violations to a felony; (c) a provision adding high schools, parks, school bus stops, and \"other place[s] where persons under eighteen (18) years of age regularly congregate\" to the safety zones that sex offenders cannot breach in § 1125 of the Penal Code and increasing the penalty for first-time violations to a felony, but also creating an exception to the safety-zone rule for registered sex offenders who have legal custody of a child so that they can attend school activities so long as they are accompanied by a 21-year-old adult who is not a sex offender; (d) a provision amending § 584 of SORA to include on the registry information about \"all occupants residing with the person registering including, but not limited to, name, date of birth, gender, relation to the person registering, and how long the occupant has resided there\"; and (e) other provisions that are too numerous to detail here.122 The Senate rejected the House amendments and requested a conference committee.123 The enrolled legislation that came out of the conference committee and was signed into law by Governor Henry included all of the provisions from the House committee substitute,124 as well as a new provision of law that made it unlawful for two or more registered sex offenders to reside together in an individual dwelling unless a group home has been authorized by the proper zoning authorities.125 The relevant portion of S.B. 1755\\'s title was:', 'An Act relating to sex offenders and children; . . . amending Section 1, Chapter 209, O.S.L. 2003 (21 O.S.

Kiesel\\'s H.B. 2569 adding new sections to SORA that would require sex offenders to be assessed and assigned a risk level to determine what degree of community notification was needed134; and (f) other provisions that are too numerous to detail here.135 The Senate rejected the House amendments and requested a conference committee.136 The enrolled legislation that came out of the conference committee and was signed into law by Governor Henry included Sen. Corn\\'s supervision and treatment program, the driver license renewal policy from H.B. 2830, residency restrictions identical to those in S.B. 1755, and other irrelevant provisions that had not previously been part of the bill.137 The relevant portion of S.B. 1964\\'s title was:', 'An Act relating to corrections; . . . amending Section 4, Chapter 457, O.S.L. 2005 (47 O.S. 2005, Section 6-105.3), which relates to identification cards; requiring sex offenders to have limited term for identification cards; providing annual renewal; setting cost the same as other identification cards; amending 47 O.S. 2001, Section 6-115, as last amended by Section 40, Chapter 5, O.S.L. 2004 (47 O.S.

In the House, eight sex offender bills were introduced--i.e., House Bills 1051, 1381, 1529, 1714, 1760, 1816, 1825, and 1993--and four were enacted. Concurrently in the Senate, seven sex offender bills were introduced--i.e., Senate Bills 35, 109, 431, 490, 680, 877, and 891--and two were enacted. As background, sex offenders filed at least two federal lawsuits in 2006 seeking to prevent enforcement of SORA\\'s residency restrictions against them--i.e., Doe v. Lane et al., No. 5:06-cv-00074-HE (W.D. Okla. filed Jan. 23, 2006), and Doe et al. v. Parish et al., No. 4:06-cv-00457-CVE-FHM (N.D. Okla. filed Sept. 1, 2006). Both lawsuits ended with settlements wherein the government officials agreed to refrain from enforcing the residency restrictions so long as the sex offenders remained at their current residences.139 But the state officials who had been sued also prompted the Legislature to amend the residency restriction during the 2007 legislative session, so as to \"provide[] more discretion to the defendants in enforcement.\"140 Thus, one bill contained provisions that were conciliatory towards sex offenders, but only because such provisions were foisted upon the Legislature to avoid future litigation. Otherwise, 2007\\'s sex offender legislation punished sex offenders with increased sentences for qualifying crimes, lengthened registration periods, restrictions upon driver\\'s licenses, and restrictions upon school attendance.', '¶38 Under new leadership, the House GOP introduced its \"Safe Families\" initiative to \"help restore . . . [a] sense of safety and demonstrate that as a state, we will keep working to reduce sexually violent crime.\"141 The initiative included a slate of three measures, two of which concerned sex offenders: H.B. 1816 and H.B. 1051.142 Representative David Dank of Oklahoma City introduced H.B. 1816, which would impose a minimum sentence of 25 years imprisonment on any sex offenses against children under 12 years of age.143 Speaker Cargill of Harrah reintroduced his bill to prevent student-aged sex offenders from attending the same school or riding the same bus as their victim or their victim\\'s sibling(s) as H.B. 1051.144 Although both bills faced committee substitutes in the House and Senate and were referred to conference, the original versions of both bills were restored and enacted when Governor Brad Henry signed them into law.145 H.B. 1816 was codified in Title 21 of the Oklahoma Statutes concerning \"Crimes & Punishment,\" and H.B. 1051 was codified in Title 70 concerning \"Schools.\"', '¶39 Representative Terry Ingmire of Stillwater introduced H.B. 1381, which would expand electronic monitoring of certain types of offenders to cover all sex offenders.146 H.B. 1381 was referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary and Public Safety, which gutted the substance of the bill in favor of a committee substitute that would give the DOC discretion to electronically monitor habitual and aggravated sex offenders based upon risk level assignments that were being considered in another bill.147 The House engrossed the committee substitute for H.B. 1381, but the bill never advanced to a committee in the Senate.148', '¶40 Representative Al Lindley of Oklahoma City introduced H.B. 1529, which would implement a risk level assignment system for juvenile sex offenders.149 H.B. 1529 was assigned to the House Committee on Human Services, where it died.150', '¶41 Representative Paul Wesselhoft of Moore introduced H.B. 1714, which would allow a sentencing court to require registration of any sex offender\\'s e-mail addresses and login credentials for messaging platforms and chat rooms and to restrict access to social networking websites that minor children utilize.151 The House engrossed H.B. 1714 to the Senate, where it was assigned to the Senate Committee on Criminal Jurisprudence.152 A committee substitute was adopted in the Senate and engrossed to the House, where it was rejected.153 Ultimately, conference was granted, and the original version of H.B. 1714 was enacted when Governor Henry signed it into law on May 31, 2007.154 H.B. 1714 was codified in Title 22 concerning \"Criminal Procedure.\"', \"¶42 Representative Anastasia Pittman of Oklahoma City introduced H.B. 1993, which would expand the class of registered sex offenders to include those who were convicted of a qualifying crime prior to SORA's 1989 effective date and who were later convicted of any other crime in Oklahoma after SORA's 1989 effective date.155 H.B. 1993 was referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary and Public Safety, where it died.156\", '¶43 In H.B. 1825 Rep. Kiesel reintroduced his bill adding new sections to SORA that would require sex offenders to be assessed and assigned a risk level to determine what degree of community notification was needed.157 H.B. 1825 was referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary and Public Safety, where it died.158 Nevertheless, the entirety of its content had also been incorporated into H.B. 1760 authored by Representative Gus Blackwell of Goodwell.159 But when H.B. 1760 was enacted, the provision concerning different degrees of public notification had been removed.160', \"¶44 That brings us to the last of the House Bills, Rep. Blackwell's H.B. 1760. As just mentioned, sections 23 through 29 of H.B. 1760 (as introduced) contained provisions identical to Representative Kiesel's 3-tiered risk level assignment system.161 But H.B. 1760 did much more: (1) sections 1 through 19 and sections 21 and 22 of H.B. 1760 would impose at least 3 years of post-imprisonment supervision upon any sex offender who had been sentenced to 2 years of imprisonment,162 despite the fact that such supervision had previously been imposed only upon sex offenders who had received a suspended sentence (i.e., no imprisonment)163; (2) sections 20 and 30 of H.B. 1760 contained the conciliatory measures that were necessitated by settlement of the federal lawsuits challenging SORA's residency restriction and the Penal Code's zones-of-safety statute164; and (3) sections 31 through 50 would enact new law creating an involuntary civil commitment procedure for long-term care and treatment of sexually violent predators, despite their lack of any diagnosis of a mental disease or defect that would otherwise allow for civil commitment.165 H.B. 1760 received minor revisions in committee substitutes from the House and Senate and was referred to conference.166 The Legislature ultimately enrolled a version of H.B. 1760 that removed both the civil-commitment provisions and Rep. Kiesel's provision regarding different degrees of public notification for different risk-level tiers and that added one provision creating the Oklahoma Statewide Gang Intervention Steering Committee to coordinate the State's response to gang activity and violence.167 Governor Henry signed H.B. 1760 into law on June 4, 2007.168 The relevant portion of H.B. 1760's title was:\", 'An Act relating to public safety; . . . amending [numerous provisions defining crimes in Titles 10 and 21 of the Oklahoma Statutes by] adding post-imprisonment supervision requirement for certain crimes; . . . clarifying zone of safety requirements; adding exception for persons receiving medical services at certain facilities; authorizing certain persons to attend religious services under specified circumstances; amending 22 O.S. 2001, Section 991a, . . . which relates to sentencing powers of the court; modifying supervision and probation provisions relating to sex offenders; amending 57 O.S. 2001, Section 582, . . . 583, . . . 584, . . . which relate to the Sex Offenders Registration Act; requiring determination of numeric risk level prior to release; directing certain information and numeric risk level be forwarded to certain entities; directing court to assign numeric risk level and provide certain notification; requiring verification of numeric risk level under certain circumstances; providing for establishment of risk assessment review committee; stating membership; stating function of committee; providing guidelines for selection of screening tool; providing for override of numeric risk level under certain circumstances; providing for the release of certain records and files; exempting risk assessment review committee meeting from certain act; clarifying registration requirements; increasing registration time periods; authorizing certain persons to petition the court for removal from registration requirements; requiring registration regardless of residency location; modifying address verification requirements; authorizing address verification by local law enforcement; requiring notification to local law enforcement of change in status; clarifying scope of liability; clarifying residency restriction requirements; providing an exception; providing exception to certain residency restriction for married persons and relatives . . . .169', 'H.B. 1760\\'s provisions were codified in Title 10 concerning \"Children,\" in Title 21 concerning \"Crimes & Punishments,\" and in Title 57 concerning \"Prisons & Reformatories.\"', '¶45 In the Senate, Sen.

Therein, \"[t]he Legislature f[ou]nd[] that sex offenders who commit other predatory acts against children and persons who prey on others as a result of mental illness pose a high risk of re-offending after release from custody.\"192 Such finding served as the basis for enacting the Oklahoma version of Megan\\'s Law, H.B. 1729, which would permit law enforcement agencies to make a sex offender\\'s registry file available for public inspection and to notify the community about the presence of a sex offender.193 It also served as the basis for the remainder of H.B. 1729, which expanded the scope of sex offenders subject to SORA, shortened their deadline for registering, removed the incentive of a shorter registration period for successfully completing the sex offender treatment program, increased the penalty for SORA violations from a misdemeanor to a felony, and imposed criminal liability upon any sex offender who worked for a daycare.194 These provisions would hinder sex offenders\\' ability to rehabilitate and reintegrate into the community and would further increase their odds of being thrown back in jail for infractions that thenceforth were felony crimes. Looking at the overall scheme of H.B. 1729 from the 1997 legislative session, it becomes apparent that the goal of the bill was both deterrence of future sex crimes and retribution against an unpopular class of convicts. As recognized in Starkey, both of these goals are traditional aims of punishment. Starkey, 2013 OK 43, ¶ 63, 305 P.3d at 1027.', '¶55 Second, turning to something that the majority opinion omits, the 2003 and 2006 amendments concerning residency restrictions in section 590 of SORA were always passed in tandem with the safety zone laws in section 1125 of the Penal Code and with numerous other sex offender provisions that clearly demonstrate the Legislature\\'s punitive intent. In 2003, H.B. 1501 enacted SORA\\'s first residency restriction that prohibited sex offenders from living within 2,000 feet of any school, and S.B. 554 enacted the Penal Code\\'s first \"zone of safety\" law that prohibited sex offenders who committed certain sex crimes against victims under the age of 13 from breaching a 300-foot safety zone around elementary and junior high schools.195 Both bills made violations a criminal offense, but only the safety zone laws were codified in the \"Crimes and Punishments\" title.196 Similarly, the 2006 amendment to SORA\\'s residency restrictions that added playgrounds, parks, and licensed daycare centers and specified the harshest means for measuring distances was enacted in the same bill--i.e., S.B. 1755--as the amendment to the Penal Code\\'s safety zone law that created safety zones around high schools, parks, school bus stops, and \"other place[s] where persons under eighteen (18) years of age regularly congregate.\"197 Also, for both the safety zone law and residency restrictions, the criminal penalties for first-time violations were increased to a felony under S.B. 1755.198 Moreover, S.B. 1755 also amended, among other things, section 991a of the code of criminal procedure (to prohibit plea deals that waive or exempt sex offenders from SORA requirements) and section 584 of SORA (to require registry information about occupants residing with sex offenders) and enacted a new section of SORA--i.e., section 590.1--that generally made it unlawful for multiple sex offenders to live together.199 Add to that the other sex offender legislation from 2006--like S.B. 1800 that made the death penalty an option for repeat sex offenders whose victims were minor children,200 and S.B. 1964 that required sex offenders to renew their driver licenses and ID cards four times more frequently than other citizens,201 and S.B. 1707 that amended section 584 of SORA to make the sex offender registry available to the State Commissioner of Health202--and the sex offender legislation from the two years on either side of 2006--including Jessica Lunsford\\'s Law from 2005 that required electronic monitoring of all sex offenders during parole and of all habitual and aggravated sex offenders for life,203 and S.B. 35 from 2007 that would require driver licenses to include the label \"Sex Offender,\"204 and H.B. 1760 from 2007 that created a risk-level assignment system for sex offenders and lengthened the amount of time each tier of sex offenders would be required to register205--and one gets the sense that Oklahoma legislators were out to score political points by enacting laws that would punish sex offenders. A review of the legislators\\' press releases and quips for the newspapers only confirms that notion, as one reads about \"the legislature\\'s fight to protect the public from sexual predators\"206; \"wag[ing] the war against sex crimes\"207; \"send[ing] a clear message to child predators in our state . . . [that] [w]e will find you, we will prosecute you, and we will put you to death\"208; the need \"to put these demented criminals behind bars and keep[] them there for as long as possible\"209; and the belief that \"[r]apists must not be allowed to skirt the requirements of our sex offender registry.\"210 Reviewing SORA\\'s residency restrictions in their full context should lead everyone to conclude that the Legislature\\'s intent was retributive and punitive.', '¶56 Third, the majority\\'s conclusion that SORA\\'s residency restrictions \"are part of the civil regulatory system intended to reduce recidivism and protect the public, specifically children\" is questionable insofar as numerous exceptions to the restrictions have been made, both in the statutory provisions and in selective enforcement of the law. For instance, the current version of section 590 that the City of El Reno wishes to enforce against Mr. Donaldson purportedly restricts him from residing \"within a two-thousand-foot radius of . . . a park that is established, operated or supported in whole or in part by a homeowner\\'s association or a city, town, county, state, federal or tribal government, [or of] a licensed child care center or family child care home as defined in the Oklahoma Child Care Facilities Licensing Act.\" 57 O.S.Supp.2019, § 590(A). But the statute proceeds to say: \"Establishment of a licensed child care center, family child care home or park in the vicinity of the residence of a registered sex offender will not require the relocation of the sex offender or the sale of the property.\" Id. In other words, it would appear the Legislature cares about the safety of the public and, in particular, children unless the sex offender already lived there first. If the law was purely civil and regulatory, there wouldn\\'t be any need for such an exemption; but the existence of the exemption seems to acknowledge the Legislature\\'s belief that the residency restriction is punitive and that its retroactive application to a sex offender who lived in the neighborhood first might violate the constitutional prohibition of ex post facto laws. Moreover, sex offenders have filed at least two federal lawsuits seeking to prevent enforcement of SORA\\'s residency restrictions against them--i.e., Doe v. Lane et al., No. 5:06-cv-00074-HE (W.D. Okla. filed Jan. 23, 2006), and Doe et al. v. Parish et al., No. 4:06-cv-00457-CVE-FHM (N.D. Okla. filed Sept. 1, 2006)--and both lawsuits ended with settlements wherein the government officials agreed to refrain from enforcing the residency restrictions so long as the sex offenders remained at their current residences.211 Again, if the real concern was protecting the public, then concessions shouldn\\'t be made; and the enforcers\\' agreements to make exceptions reveal their appreciation of the residency restriction\\'s punitive nature and the resulting ex post facto problem. The exceptions that have been made via lawsuit settlements and statutory exemptions demonstrate that the Legislature\\'s true goal wasn\\'t protection of the public through a uniformly applied civil, regulatory scheme.', '¶57 For all these reasons, I believe the Oklahoma Legislature intended to make the residency restrictions in § 590 of SORA punitive.', '¶58 Before proceeding to a discussion of the second prong of the \"intent-effects\" test, I must address the majority\\'s adoption and application of the \"clearest proof\" burden to that second prong. Without discussion, the majority invokes the \"clearest proof\" burden with a quotation from Smith v. Doe, 538 U.S. 84, 92 (2003), and a citation that signals us to \"see\" Starkey at ¶ 77. See Majority Op. ¶ 19. As the majority notes, in that paragraph the Starkey Court \"f[ou]nd there is clear proof that the effect of the retroactive application of SORA\\'s registration is punitive and outweighs its non-punitive purpose.\" Id. ¶ 19 n.10 (citing Starkey, 2013 OK 43, ¶ 77, 305 P.3d at 1030 (emphasis added)). Interestingly, the majority acknowledges that \"[t]he City stresses that the majority in Starkey rejected the clearest proof standard and adopted an alternative standard set forth in Justice Ginsburg\\'s dissent in Smith v. Doe\" and that \"the Starkey opinion does include some discussion of Justice Souter and Justice Ginsburg\\'s dissatisfaction with the clearest proof standard.\" Id. Nevertheless, the majority chooses to ignore such information because of its determination that the Starkey Court\\'s finding of clear proof is equivalent to application of the clearest proof burden. Id.', \"¶59 This is nothing more than a veiled attempt to overrule one aspect of the Starkey precedent that the majority dislikes and to revert back to the U.S. Supreme Court's higher burden of proof from Smith v. Doe that Starkey rejected. In ¶¶ 44 and 45 of the Starkey opinion, this Court adopted a less stringent burden of proof:\", 'Starkey, 2013 Ok 43, ¶¶ 44--45, 305 P.3d 1020--21 (footnotes omitted) (emphasis added). These paragraphs make it readily apparent that Starkey did adopt a lower burden of proof to provide \"a neutral framework for determining SORA\\'s purpose and effects\" because \"there [wa]s no clear legislative characterization that SORA is a civil law\" and that the reason for adopting a neutral framework was to provide ex post facto protections beyond those afforded by the federal constitution. Had SORA included a clear statement of legislative intent that it was not punitive, there would have been no reason to quote Justice Souter\\'s concurrence or Justice Ginsburg\\'s dissent. Similarly, had we adopted the clearest-proof burden, there would have been no need to discuss our State Constitution\\'s ability to provide more protection at \"the ceiling\" than what the federal constitution provides at the \"floor.\" In fact, everything after the first sentence in ¶ 44 of Starkey would have been superfluous unless we were adopting a lower, more \"neutral\" burden of proof.', '¶60 The majority\\'s attempt to confuse the matter by referencing Starkey\\'s ultimate finding of \"clear proof that the effect of the retroactive application of SORA\\'s registration is punitive\" is misguided. See Majority Op. ¶ 19 n.10 (quoting Starkey, 2013 OK 43, ¶ 77, 305 P.3d at 1030). The fact that Starkey subsequently found \"clear proof\" does not undermine our adoption of a neutral framework; it merely speaks to the one-sidedness of the evidence in Starkey. A finding of clear proof is not the same as a statement that clearest proof must be found or that the clearest-proof burden applies.', '¶61 Moreover, the appealing parties concede that the Starkey Court did not adopt the clearest proof burden. In his brief, the Attorney General stated: \"Importantly, the [U.S.] Supreme Court held \\'that only the clearest proof that a law is punitive based on substantial factors will be able to overcome the legislative categorization\\' of the statute as civil. Smith, 538 U.S. at 92 (emphasis added). Instead of embracing the U.S. Supreme Court\\'s standard, Starkey cited Justice Souter\\'s concurring opinion and Justice Ginsburg\\'s dissenting opinion from Smith that each disputed applying the \\'clearest proof\\' approach . . . .\" State\\'s Br. 6. Similarly, the City of El Reno\\'s attorney admitted at oral argument that \"[t]he [Starkey] Court did not adopt the clearest proof standard that the U.S. Supreme Court adopted in Smith v. Doe\" and that \"under Starkey\" we would \"stick with the neutral evaluation standard\" is certainly not authoritative. Okla. Sup. Ct. Oral Argument Case No. 120,617 at 15:50--:56, 1:18:16--:21, available at https://vimeo.com/ 908699917/c4ef035ab9?share=copy. Although their concessions are not authoritative, they do lend support to my reading of Starkey at the same time that they disparage the majority\\'s reading.', '¶62 For these reasons, I dissent to the majority\\'s adoption and application of the \"clearest proof\" burden. I would apply the neutral burden of proof that this Court adopted in Starkey for determining whether the effects of the sex offender legislation at issue are punitive.', '¶63 Before I move on, however, I would be remiss not to address the City of El Reno\\'s arguments raised at oral argument that Starkey fails to explain how or why Oklahoma\\'s ex post facto clause could provide greater protection than the nearly identical federal clause. See Majority Op. ¶ 21 n.11. My response is twofold. First, there is an explanation within Starkey\\'s quotations from Justice Souter\\'s concurrence and Justice Ginsburg\\'s dissent to demonstrate that there is no real consensus on why the federal constitution should require clearest proof and thus provide less protection. Second, this argument is recycled from the Starkey dissents, see Starkey, 2013 OK 43, ¶ 7 n.7, 305 P.3d at 1034 n.7 (Winchester, J., dissenting), and was flatly rejected. The Oklahoma Constitution provides more protection because six Justices on this Court looked at the debate between the Smith v. Doe majority and Justices Souter and Ginsburg and decided to go with a more robust ex post facto clause that didn\\'t require \"clearest proof.\" In other words, the Oklahoma Constitution provides more protection because six Justices on this Court said so. See generally Okla. Sup. Ct. Oral Argument Case No. 120,617 at 31:07--32:07 (wherein City\\'s counsel said she wasn\\'t sure Starkey\\'s interpretation of Oklahoma\\'s ex post facto clause as providing more protection than its federal counterpart was justified, and Justice Kauger responded: \"Well, right now it is because we said so\"), available at https://vimeo.com/908699917/c4ef035ab9?share=copy.', '¶64 Finally, even if I assumed the Oklahoma Legislature\\'s intent in enacting SORA\\'s residency restrictions was civil in nature--much as Starkey did--I would ultimately strike down as unconstitutional the residency restrictions as applied retroactively to Mr. Donaldson due to their punitive effects. Looking at the majority\\'s assessment of the seven Mendoza-Martinez factors, I only agree with their conclusions that the first factor \"weighs in favor of a punitive effect\" and that the third factor should be \"given little weight.\" See Majority Op. ¶¶ 31, 35.', '¶65 As a preliminary matter, I take issue with the majority\\'s heavy reliance upon Smith v. Doe and several other federal appellate court cases decided since, and therefore constrained by the outcome in, Smith. See, e.g., Majority Op. ¶¶ 34, 36-- 39, 42 (citing Smith, 538 U.S. at 102--05; McGuire v. Marshall, 50 F.4th 986, 1008--09 (11th Cir. 2022); Shaw v. Patton, 823 F.3d 556, 566--68, 571, 574, 576--77 (10th Cir. 2016); Doe v. Miller, 405 F.3d 700, 720--22 (8th Cir. 2005); Hatton v. Bonner, 356 F.3d 955, 965 (9th Cir. 2004)). Such reliance is misplaced because the Starkey Court knew it was reaching a different conclusion than Smith. My majority opinion referenced Smith twenty-two times. Starkey, 2013 OK 43, ¶¶ 40--41, 43--45, 47, 49, 55, 58--59, 65, 70, 74--75, 305 P.3d at 1019--22, 1024--25, 1027--30. We also acknowledged (unlike today\\'s majority) that the outcome of Smith was later undone when the Alaska Supreme Court found that Alaska\\'s Sex Offender Registration Act did violate the Alaska Constitution\\'s ex post facto clause. Id. ¶ 40, 305 P.3d at 1019 (taking issue with cases cited by the DOC because those cases did not mention Doe v. State, 189 P.3d 999 (Alaska 2008)). We then went through the seven Mendoza-Martinez factors, but we repeatedly found ourselves persuaded more by the concurrence and dissents in Smith, by the Alaska Supreme Court\\'s Doe v. State opinion, and by other courts that disagreed with Smith. Id. ¶¶ 49, 55--56, 59--60, 65, 74--75, 305 P.3d at 1022, 1024--30 (citing Smith, 538 U.S. at 111 (Stevens, J., dissenting); Smith, 538 U.S. at 109 (Souter, J., concurring in judgment); Smith, 538 U.S. at 116--17 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting); Doe, 189 P.3d at 1012; Commonwealth v. Baker, 295 S.W.3d 437, 444 (Ky. 2009); Wallace v. State, 905 N.E.2d 371, 380 (Ind. 2009)). In a drive-by concurrence, Justice Gurich explicitly stated that \"[t]he dissenters\\' reliance on Smith v. Doe, 538 U.S. 84 is misplaced because the Alaska registration system reviewed in that case did not have the constitutional infirmities present in this case.\" Id. ¶ 85, 305 P.3d at 1031 (Gurich, J., concurring). Justice Taylor\\'s drive-by dissent cited Smith in support of his conclusion that SORA \"is a civil, nonpunitive, noncriminal regulatory program that does not violate any ex post facto concerns when applied retroactively. Smith v. Doe, 538 U.S. 84.\" Id. ¶ 88, 305 P.3d at 1032 (Taylor, J., dissenting). And Justice Winchester\\'s dissent was replete with references to Smith (thirty-six in the body of the writing), criticizing the majority in its opening paragraph because \"[t]he majority opinion also conflicts with the opinion of the United States Supreme Court in Smith v. Doe . . . .\" Id. ¶ 1, 305 P.3d at 1032 (Winchester, J., dissenting). We duly considered Smith\\'s outcome, but a six-member majority decided to spurn a similar outcome with respect to SORA in light of Oklahoma\\'s ex post facto clause.', '¶66 Similarly, the majority utilizes opinions from lower federal courts to stack its deck in declaring that it is \"join[ing] the majority of courts from other jurisdictions having assessed the constitutionality of similar residency restrictions.\" Majority Op. ¶ 44 n.18. The majority cites cases from four U.S. Courts of Appeals, one U.S. District Court, and four state appellate courts. See id. (citing McGuire, 50 F.3th 986 (Eleventh Circuit); Shaw, 823 F.3d at 577 (Tenth Circuit); Weems v. Little Rock Police Dep\\'t, 453 F.3d 1010, 1017 (8th Cir. 2006); Miller, 405 F.3d at 720 (also Eighth Circuit); Hatton, 356 F.3d at 965 (Ninth Circuit); Doe 1 v. City of Apple Valley, 487 F. SupP.3d 761, 774 (D. Minn. 2020); People v. Mosley, 344 P.3d 788, 804 (Cal. 2005); People v. Leroy, 828 N.E.2d 769. 782 (Ill. App. Ct. 2005); Standley v. Town of Woodfin, 650 S.E.2d 618, 622--23 (N.C. Ct. App. 2007), aff\\'d, 661 S.E.2d 728 (N.C. 2008); City of South Milwaukee v. Kester, 2013 WI App 50, ¶ 31, 830 N.W.2d 710, 721). The majority does acknowledge two state appellate courts in the minority. Id. (citing State v. Pollard, 908 N.E.2d 1145, 1152 (Ind. 2009); Baker, 295 S.W.3d at 444 (Kentucky)). The federal case law should be completely discounted, as Smith v. Doe controlled and compelled the outcomes in those cases. Moreover, even though the California Supreme Court found that residency restrictions didn\\'t violate the ex post facto clause in the Mosley case, that court later found that \"blanket enforcement of the mandatory residency restrictions of Jessica\\'s Law, as applied to registered sex offenders on parole in San Diego County, . . . has imposed harsh and severe restrictions and disabilities on the affected parolees\\' liberty and privacy rights, however limited, while producing conditions that hamper, rather than foster, efforts to monitor, supervise, and rehabilitate these persons. Accordingly, it bears no rational relationship to advancing the state\\'s legitimate goal of protecting children from sexual predators, and has infringed the affected parolees\\' basic constitutional [due process] right to be free of official action that is unreasonable arbitrary, and oppressive.\" In re Taylor, 343 P.3d 867, 879 (Cal. 2015). Thus, California\\'s commitment to the majority\\'s cause appears to be in question. That leaves three or four state appellate decisions in favor of today\\'s majority versus two against--hardly enough of a sampling to constitute a meaningful \"majority of courts from other jurisdictions.\"', '¶67 With those preliminary matters out of the way, I will now address the second, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh Mendoza-Martinez factors.', '¶68 Regarding the second factor--i.e., whether residency restrictions \"ha[ve] historically been regarded as a punishment\"--the majority\\'s conclusion that \"this factor does not support a punitive effect\" should be precluded by Starkey. In Starkey, this Court specifically invoked the residency restrictions in its analysis of this second factor and reached the opposite conclusion:', 'Starkey, 2013 OK 43, ¶¶ 60--61, 305 P.3d at 1025--26 (footnotes omitted) (citing Baker, 295 S.W.3d at 444).', '¶69 Nevertheless, today\\'s majority takes a different path. First, it presents an ad hominem attack against Mr. Donaldson. See Majority Op. ¶ 33. Essentially, they discredit the notion that SORA\\'s residency restrictions are analogous to banishment because Mr. Donaldson isn\\'t being kicked out of a house in which he already lives but is trying to live in a house he purchased after police told him he couldn\\'t live there. Second, the majority rejects the Baker case as unpersuasive because of its discussion of \"expel[ling] registrants from their homes,\" which is not Mr. Donaldson\\'s scenario. Majority Op. ¶ 33. Finally, the majority relies upon federal precedent defining \"[t]he cornerstones of banishment\" as \"complete expulsion from a community\" and \"prohibiting offenders from even being present in the restricted area\" coupled with their acceptance of the City of El Reno\\'s assertion that \"57 O.S., § 590 does not prohibit Donaldson from recreating or accessing the facilities at Lake El Reno\" to conclude that the residency restrictions don\\'t rise to the level of banishment. Id. ¶ 34 (quoting Shaw, 823 F.3d at 566--68).', '¶70 The majority\\'s \"deeper understanding of the historic punishment of banishment\" in light of federal case law is incorrect. Shaw\\'s first description of banishment as \"complete expulsion from a community\" is nothing new. Smith itself described banishment as \"expel[ling] [a person] from the community,\" Smith, 538 U.S. at 98; and Starkey explicitly acknowledged Smith\\'s description of banishment as \"expulsion from the community,\" Starkey, 2013 OK 43, ¶ 58 & n.83, 305 P.3d at 1025 & n.83 (citing Smith, 538 U.S. at 98). The Starkey Court knew what banishment was. It didn\\'t need a \"deeper understanding.\" Although the majority acknowledges in a later part of their opinion \"that there are likely some sex offenders who are not in compliance with the current residency restrictions and will need to move,\" Majority Op. ¶ 45, the majority fails to appreciate that such sex offenders are being \"expel[led] . . . from their homes,\" Starkey, 2013 OK 43, ¶ 60, 305 P.3d at 1026.212 Shaw\\'s second description leads the majority to endorse the City of El Reno\\'s point that the residency restrictions in \"§ 590(A) [of SORA] do[] not prohibit Donaldson from recreating or accessing the facilities at Lake El Reno.\" Majority Op. ¶ 34 (referencing City\\'s Br. 14). While it may be true that § 590(A) of SORA doesn\\'t restrict him in this manner, the safety zone laws in § 1125 of the Penal Code do. I brought this up at oral argument. Okla. Sup. Ct. Oral Argument Case No. 120,617 at 8:40--9:51, available at https://vimeo.com/908699917/c4ef035ab9? share=copy. Nevertheless, the majority continues to ignore the import of the safety zone laws in § 1125 that were enacted in conjunction with SORA\\'s residency restrictions. See supra ¶ 55. Under § 1125, as currently drafted, Mr. Donaldson is forbidden from \"entering any park\" and from \"loitering within five hundred (500) feet of any . . . park.\" To the extent Lake El Reno may be a park,213 Mr. Donaldson cannot engage in \"recreat[ion] or access[] the facilities\" there. Thus, he is \"prohibit[ed] . . . from even being present in the restricted area.\" Said another way, he meets Shaw\\'s second definition for banishment. Thus, the majority\\'s reliance upon Shaw to conclude that this second Mendoza-Martinez factor does not support a punitive effect is erroneous.', \"¶71 Beyond that, however, the majority and the federal cases upon which they rely ignore the unspoken motivation behind residency restrictions and safety zone laws, which is to force sex offenders out of town.214 That motivation only becomes clearer considering other sex offender laws that make finding employment tougher. See supra ¶¶ 55, 62--63, 67 (discussing the enactment of bills that restricted sex offenders from working at daycare facilities, at schools, at nursing homes, and as law enforcement officers). That motivation becomes crystal clear considering the fact that legislators have made Mr. Donaldson's sex offender status the predicate for new crimes. Residing near a park is only a crime for sex offenders like Mr. Donaldson, and any violation of that law can result in his complete removal from society for one to three years upon the first violation and for no less than three years upon a subsequent violation. 57 O.S.Supp.2019, § 590(A), (D). In other words, even if sex offenders can't be forced to move out of town, maybe town officials and residents can make it so difficult for them to find a place to live that they will violate the law and be removed from town for years at a time through further incarceration for conduct that isn't criminal for anyone else but them. The motivation behind these laws demonstrates the desire to effect complete expulsion from a community.\", '¶72 The main disagreement between today\\'s majority and the Starkey Court arises primarily from a difference in opinion over whether SORA must be identical to historical punishments or whether it must merely resemble them or be similar to them. Therein lies a major problem with characterizing sex offender registration laws in terms of \"historical punishment,\" as such laws \"are of fairly recent origin.\" Smith, 538 U.S. at 97 (quoting Doe I, 259 F.3d at 989). That is why we cannot look for an exact match. In Starkey, a six-member majority deliberately decided to spurn Smith\\'s analysis of this factor in favor of more persuasive reasoning they found in the Alaska Supreme Court\\'s Doe v. State opinion and in the Kentucky Supreme Court\\'s Baker case. See Starkey, 2013 OK 43, ¶¶ 58--60 & nn.82--84, 88--89, 305 P.3d at 1025--26 & nn.82--84, 88--89 (citing Smith, 538 U.S. at 97--98; Doe, 189 P.3d at 1012; Baker, 295 S.W.3d at 444). The majority would obviously prefer to sideline Starkey\\'s conclusion that the residency restrictions help demonstrate SORA\\'s punitive effects, as it seems like binding precedent in Mr. Donaldson\\'s case. Nothing about SORA\\'s residency restrictions has gotten less restrictive since Starkey; rather, the restrictions have only gotten worse. See supra notes 187--191 and accompanying text.', \"¶73 For all the reasons already discussed, I believe this second Mendoza-Martinez factor weighs in favor of characterizing SORA's residency restrictions as punitive in effect.\", '¶74 Regarding the fourth factor, the majority\\'s determination that residency restrictions don\\'t promote the traditional aims of retribution and deterrence is a foregone conclusion based upon their errant adoption of the \"clearest proof\" burden and mistaken determination that the legislative intent was non-punitive. See Majority Op. ¶ 37 (\"[P]rohibiting sex offenders from living within 2,000 feet of certain locations where children are often present is not an expression of condemnation that is sufficiently clear or strong enough to negate the legislature\\'s non-punitive intent.\"). The majority apparently agrees with Starkey\\'s finding that, while \"SORA promotes deterrence through threat of negative consequences, such as eviction and living restrictions,\" such determination \"does not in and of itself impose a punishment.\" Id. ¶ 36 (citing Starkey, 2013 OK 43, ¶ 63, 305 P.3d at 1027). The majority then takes the opportunity to cite Smith and several other federal appellate court cases decided since Smith (and therefore falling in line with it) that discuss how a civil, regulatory law\\'s indirect promotion of deterrence does not weigh strongly in favor of a punitive effect. Id. (citing Smith, 538 U.S. at 102; Shaw, 823 F.3d at 571; Miller, 405 F.3d at 720; Hatton, 356 F.3d at 965). The majority concludes that \"any deterrent purpose is merely incidental\" because \"the purpose of the residency restrictions is not so much to deter the commission of the original sex offense that triggered SORA as it is to deter or, more accurately, prevent the sex offender from committing another sex offense in the future.\" Id. With confidence, the majority asserts that \"[i]t is the threat of being imprisoned (if caught and convicted) that is intended to deter the original sex crime--not restrictions on where you can live after being released.\" Id.', '¶75 I disagree with most of the majority\\'s reasoning on deterrence. A six-member majority in Starkey deliberately rejected Smith\\'s analysis of this factor in favor of more persuasive reasoning they found in Justice Souter\\'s concurrence and in the Kentucky Supreme Court\\'s case. See Starkey, 2013 OK 43, ¶¶ 63, 65 & nn.93, 96, 305 P.3d at 1027--28 & nn.93, 96 (quoting Smith, 538 U.S. at 108--09 (Souter, J., concurring in judgment); Baker, 295 S.W.3d at 444; citing Smith, 538 U.S. at 102). The majority\\'s reliance upon Smith and Smith\\'s reliance upon Hudson v. United States, 522 U.S. 93, 99 (1997), seems misplaced. Hudson is a double jeopardy case. Both double jeopardy jurisprudence and ex post facto jurisprudence utilize the intent-effects test and the Mendoza-Martinez factors. But the idea of incidental deterrence seems to have more force and effect in double jeopardy cases where an individual who was not a criminal was deterred from conduct because such conduct could simultaneously result in both regulatory discipline and criminal prosecution. Thus, the criminal statutes deter the individual from committing certain criminal conduct, and the civil regulations \"incidentally\" deter the individual from committing the same conduct. That doesn\\'t render the civil regulations punitive such that a person who has been disciplined pursuant to the civil regulations can later avoid criminal prosecution under the constitutional right against double jeopardy. The logic of this double jeopardy scenario doesn\\'t carry over, however, when we try to apply it in Mr. Donaldson\\'s ex post facto case. That\\'s because we now have two criminal statutes in play and one so-called \"civil regulation.\" The first criminal statute is the one forbidding the sex offense, which was first-degree rape in Mr. Donaldson\\'s case. The so-called \"civil regulation\"--which is the residency restriction in Mr. Donaldson\\'s case--doesn\\'t come into play until after he becomes a convicted sex offender and completes his sentence (including probation) under the first criminal statute. Thus, in one sense there\\'s no way the \"civil, regulatory\" residency restriction can deter commission of the original sex offense because the residency restriction doesn\\'t even apply until after the commission of the original sex offense. That makes this ex post facto case completely different from a double jeopardy case. But in another sense, the majority shouldn\\'t be so confident in asserting that \"the purpose of the residency restrictions . . . is to deter or, more accurately, prevent the sex offender from committing another sex offense in the future,\" Majority Op. ¶ 36, because some legislators apparently intend for the residency restrictions to deter the original crime. See Coppernoll et al., supra note 212, at 1A (wherein an Oklahoma legislator suggests that residency restrictions should be a deterrent for the original crime: \"\\'My heart bleeds for them very little,\\' said state Rep. Randy Terrill, R-Moore. Terrill is a co-sponsor of several bills that included the residency restriction. \\'The solution is real simple . . . don\\'t commit the crime.\\'\" (ellipsis in original)). The logic breaks down yet again because a second criminal statute comes into play--i.e., the statute making it a crime for him to violate the residency restrictions--at the same time the civil, regulatory rule comes into play. That\\'s because the second criminal statute and the civil, regulatory rule are contained in the very same statute. See 57 O.S.Supp.2019, § 590(A) (forbidding Mr. Donaldson from living within 2,000 of a city park); id. § 590(D) (making \"[a]ny person willfully violating the provision of this section by: 1. [i]ntentionally moving into any neighborhood or to any real estate or home within the prohibited distance . . . guilty of a felony\"). In the Hudson double-jeopardy case, the civil regulations weren\\'t contained in the same title as the criminal statute. If the sex offender violates the new \"civil, regulatory\" rules governing where he can live, work, or \"loiter,\" he can be prosecuted for committing a new felony crime that\\'s not related to the original sex offense or another sex offense. The logic just falls apart. Moreover, unlike the average citizen, the sex offender can be prosecuted for working where he shouldn\\'t have worked, living where he shouldn\\'t have lived, or lingering where he shouldn\\'t have lingered. I wouldn\\'t characterize this sort of deterrence as \"merely incidental.\"', \"¶76 At this juncture, it should be apparent that the residency restrictions' creation of new crimes for sex offenders only tends to demonstrate a retributive effect. As in Starkey, I am still persuaded by Justice Souter's concurrence in Smith:\", 'Smith, 538 U.S. at 108--09 (Souter, J., concurring in judgment) (citations omitted) (emphasis added). The 2003 and 2006 amendments concerning residency restrictions in § 590 of SORA were always passed in tandem with the safety zone laws in § 1125 of the Penal Code, and they always carried a criminal sanction for violations. See supra ¶ 55. Add to that the other sex offender legislation from 2005 to 2007, and one gets the sense that Oklahoma legislators were out to score political points by enacting laws that would punish sex offenders. Id.', \"¶77 Suffice it to say, SORA's residency restrictions promote both deterrence and retribution, which are traditional aims of punishment; and this fourth Mendoza-Martinez factor weighs in favor of characterizing the residency restrictions as punitive in effect.\", '¶78 With regard to the fifth factor, the majority recognizes Starkey\\'s determination that \"SORA applies only to behavior that is already a crime\" such that \"this Mendoza-Martinez factor has a punitive effect,\" yet they conclude \"this factor should be given little weight.\" Majority Op. ¶ 36 (quoting Starkey, 2013 OK 43, ¶ 68, 305 P.3d at 1028). In support of this decision, the majority quotes Smith v. Doe for the proposition that the \"past conduct, which was, and is, a crime . . . is a necessary beginning point [for the regulatory scheme], for recidivism is the statutory concern.\" Id. (quoting Smith, 538 U.S. at 105). The majority then cites an Iowa Supreme Court case in support of their conclusion that, \"while this factor weighs in favor of finding the scheme punitive, it does so only slightly.\" Id. (quoting In re Interest of T.H., 913 N.W.2d 578, 594 (Iowa 2018)).', '¶79 Regarding the majority\\'s assertion that recidivism is the statutory concern, I doubt that. \"[I]f recidivism were the only concern, the statute would apply not only to convicted sex offenders, but also to other defendants who might pose a threat to society even if they are not convicted,\" such as sex offenders \"charged with sex offenses but found incompetent to stand trial, [those] found not guilty by reason of insanity, and those committed to mental health facilities as sexual psychopaths.\" Wallace, 905 N.E.2d at 382 (citing Doe, 189 P.3d at 1014). But the risk level assignments at issue in Starkey apply only to convicted sex offenders. It is the determination of guilt for one of these sex offenses that triggers the registration requirement and residency restrictions, not merely the fact of the conduct or the potential for recidivism. See Letalien, 985 A.2d at 22 (\"Because registration under SORNA of 1999 only applies to offenders who were convicted of specified crimes, does not arise based on individualized assessment of an offender\\'s risk of recidivism, and cannot be waived based on proof that an offender poses little or no risk, SORNA of 1999 applies exclusively to behavior that is already a crime.\"). Because the criminal conviction itself triggers application of the residency restrictions, such restrictions appear to be further retribution based on the original criminal conduct. Smith, 538 U.S. at 109 (Souter, J., concurring in judgment).', '¶80 Thus, the residency restrictions apply exclusively to behavior that is already a crime for purposes of retribution, and this factor should weigh heavily in favor of characterizing them as punitive in effect.', '¶81 With regard to the sixth Mendoza-Martinez factor, the majority seems comfortable concluding that \"the residency restrictions have a rational connection to the provision\\'s non-punitive objectives of protecting the public and reducing recidivism,\" pointing to Mr. Donaldson\\'s concession on this point and Starkey\\'s previous conclusion that this factor weighs in favor of characterizing SORA\\'s registration requirements as non-punitive in effect. Majority Op. ¶ 39 (quoting Starkey, 2013 OK 43, ¶ 69, 305 P.3d at 1028). But the majority apparently wants this factor to be outcome-determinative, relying upon Smith v. Doe\\'s characterization of this factor as \"a most significant factor\" even though Mendoza-Martinez itself emphasized that \"no one factor should be considered controlling.\" Hudson, 522 U.S. at 101 (citing Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U.S. at 169).', '¶82 For reasons I previously discussed, however, I question whether the residency restrictions are rationally connected to the purported nonpunitive goals of public safety or the prevention of recidivism. In Commonwealth v. Baker, 295 S.W.3d 437 (Ky. 2009), the Kentucky Supreme Court concluded that the sex offender statute \"d[id] not have a rational connection to a nonpunitive purpose.\" Id. at 445--46. I think the same could be said for Oklahoma\\'s residency restrictions and safety zone laws.', '¶83 Numerous exceptions to the restrictions exist, both in the statutory provisions and in selective enforcement of the law. If protecting the public was the real goal, then the Legislature wouldn\\'t make exceptions to the residency restrictions that \"grandfather in\" any sex offenders living in proximity to a park or playground, and law enforcement agencies wouldn\\'t be creating exceptions for the enforcement of residency restrictions in their lawsuit settlements. See supra ¶ 56.', '¶84 Additionally, there is a growing sentiment that suggests residency restrictions put the public in more danger because they encourage sex offenders to live off the grid. See Coppernoll et al., supra note 212, at 1A (\"Some say the law may put Oklahoma\\'s children in more danger. . . . Instead of leaving city limits, many offenders will simply fall off the registry, said [police Sgt. John] Adams, who heads the child exploitation unit for the Tulsa police. That appears to be happening already. Adams said 40 sex offenders dropped off Tulsa\\'s registry in the first month the new [residency restriction] law was in effect.\"); Mock & Dean, supra note 159, at 6A (\"Police and corrections officials who track offenders said the residency restrictions, tightened last year, are driving more offenders off the registry list, making it difficult to track them and increasing the likelihood they will reoffend.\"). If the real concern was recidivism, then the Legislature would have targeted only those convicted sex offenders who pose the greatest risk of recidivism, only those convicted sex offenders whose crimes involved children that can be found at the restricted playgrounds and parks, or--on the flip side--everyone whose underlying conduct constitutes a sex offense and not just those convicted of a sex offense. See Wallace, 905 N.E.2d at 382.', '¶85 There is also a growing body of research indicating that residency restrictions actually increase the risk of recidivism. See People ex rel.

Doe, other federal case law, and one California case that would permit such an overbroad rule. Majority Op. ¶ 42 (quoting Smith, 538 U.S. at 103--04; People v. Mosley, 344 P.3d 788, 804 (Cal. 2015); citing Shaw, 823 F.3d at 576--77; Miller, 405 P.3d at 721--22).', \"¶88 In Starkey, a six-member majority of this Court made the deliberate decision to reject Smith's analysis of this seventh factor and to adopt reasoning they found more persuasive that appeared in Justice Ginsburg's dissent in Smith and in the Alaska Supreme Court's case that effectively undid Smith. See Starkey, 2013 OK 43, ¶¶ 70, 74 & n.100, 305 P.3d at 1028--30 & n.100 (citing Smith, 538 U.S. at 105; Smith, 538 U.S. at 116--17 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting); Doe, 189 P.3d at 1016).\", '¶89 Furthermore, it should be plain that the residency restrictions are excessive--particularly with respect to the illegitimate nonpunitive purposes proffered by the City of El Reno, see supra ¶¶ 81--86 (discussing how there is no rational connection to the stated goals of public safety and reduced recidivism). Section 590 of SORA does not make any type of individualized assessment as to whether a particular offender is a threat to public safety.215 Residency restrictions are imposed on every registered sex offender, whether they be repeat child molesters, one-time flashers, or drunken college students caught urinating in public.216 The restrictions that keep sex offenders away from locales that children frequent applies to all sex offenders regardless of whether their crimes involved a child. The restrictions apply to sex offenders from all risk levels under the tier system enacted in 2007, including those given a level assignment of \"1\" because they \"pose[] a low danger to the community and will not likely engage in criminal sexual conduct\" and those formerly classified as \"habitual or aggravated sex offender[s]\" who are given a level assignment of \"3\" because they \"pose[] a serious danger to the community and will continue to engage in criminal sexual conduct.\" 57 O.S.Supp.2019, §§ 583(C)(3), 582.5(C)(1), (3). How can that be if the goal truly is to protect the public? Wouldn\\'t that goal require different treatment of level 1 and level 3 offenders, because either the level 1 offenders are being treated harshly or the level 3 offenders aren\\'t being treated harsh enough? The residency restrictions impose severe restraints on sex offenders\\' liberty without a determination of the threat a particular registrant poses to public safety. The scope of the residency restrictions exceeds the stated purposes of protecting the public and reducing recidivism. Consequently, this seventh Mendoza-Martinez factor also weighs in favor of characterizing the residency restrictions as punitive in effect.', \"¶90 Looking at my review of the Mendoza-Martinez factors under the neutral framework adopted by Starkey, six factors favor a finding that the residency restrictions are punitive in effect, and the seventh should be given little weight. The residency restrictions don't bear any rational connection to the nonpunitive purpose proffered by the majority and the City of El Reno. Therefore, the residency restrictions are extremely excessive in view of those nonpunitive purposes. Moreover, the residency restrictions impose an affirmative disability and restraint upon sex offenders, bear a strong resemblance to the historical punishment of banishment, only apply to conduct that is already criminal, and further the traditional aims of punishment. Although clear proof isn't necessary, there seems to be clear proof here that the effects of retroactively applying SORA's residency restrictions are punitive and would outweigh any nonpunitive purposes.\", \"¶91 This dissent is not intended to be a defense of Mr. Donaldson, whose past crimes are reprehensible, or of sex offenders at large. Instead, my aim is to see the ex post facto prohibition in the Oklahoma Constitution upheld and enforced. Sex offenders should be punished in accordance with the law in effect at the time their sex offense was committed, and their registration requirements should be set using the law in effect at the time of their conviction. Thereafter, the government shouldn't be allowed to repeatedly move the goalposts through amendments to the laws defining punishments and registration requirements. Said another way, you can throw the book at them as it existed at the time of their offense, but you can't keep adding chapters or trying to change the ending. They would still be a registered sex offender.\", '¶92 Oklahoma\\'s ex post facto clause forbids the Legislature from \"retroactively alter[ing] the definition of crimes or increas[ing] the punishment for criminal acts.\" Starkey, 2013 OK 43, ¶ 37, 305 P.3d at 1018 (quoting Collins v. Youngblood, 497 U.S. 37, 43 (1990)). Through this prohibition the framers of our state constitution, like their federal counterparts, \"sought to assure that legislative Acts give fair warning of their effect and permit individuals to rely on their meaning until explicitly changed.\" Weaver v. Graham, 450 U.S. 24, 28--29 (1981); see also The Federalist No. 44, at 282 (James Madison) (stating that \"ex post facto laws . . . are contrary to the first principles of the social compact and to every principle of sound Legislation\"); The Federalist No. 84, at 511--12 (Alexander Hamilton) (observing that \"the prohibition of ex post facto laws, and TITLES OF NOBILITY . . . are perhaps greater securities to liberty and republicanism than any it [i.e., the Constitution] contains. The creation of crimes after the commission of the fact, or in other words, the subjecting of men to punishment for things which, when they were done, were breaches of no law, and the practice of arbitrary imprisonments have been in all ages the favorite and most formidable instruments of tyranny\"). Sex offenders are entitled to fair warning, the same as anyone else.', '¶93 The City of El Reno\\'s retroactive application of the residency restrictions to Mr. Donaldson is inconsistent with the ex post facto clause in the Oklahoma Constitution. I agree with the result of the trial court\\'s summary judgment, which found the residency restrictions in the current version of § 590 of SORA should not be retroactively applied to Mr. Donaldson. This Court should apply the date-of-conviction rule adopted in Cerniglia v. Oklahoma Department of Corrections, 2013 OK 81, 349 P.3d 542, such that Mr. Donaldson would continue to be prohibited from \"resid[ing] within a two thousand-foot radius of any public or private school site or educational institution.\" 57 O.S.Supp.2004, § 590.', '¶94 For all these reasons, I respectfully dissent.', 'FOOTNOTES', '1 As the majority points out, these factors were first set forth in the U.S. Supreme Court case of Kennedy v.

The change would allow law enforcement to focus their efforts and resources on those who are the biggest threat, supporters say. \\'The key component is supervision,\\' said Rep. Gus Blackwell, R-Goodwell. \\'When you hear the word \"sex offender,\" you immediately think of a child rapist. There are so many other people caught within that; this makes the system more fair.\\' It also may mean only the tightest living restrictions would be applied to the sex offenders who remain a risk. . . . Details of the legislation are being worked out in the Legislature. The proposal would set up a risk assessment review committee at the Corrections Department. The committee would look at each case before a sex offender\\'s release from prison and give each person a risk level ranking. That ranking would be tied to how long offenders must register and eventually could determine where they can live.\"). Alas, the Legislature ultimately only used the risk levels to assign different lengths of time for registration, with 15 years of registration for level 1 offenders, 25 years of registration for level 2 offenders, and life registration for level 3 offenders.

BACKGROUND & PROCEDURAL HISTORY', '¶2 This matter first originated on June 6, 2013, when Tracy L. Clark and Edward A. Clark, Petitioners/Appellants/Guardians, filed a petition for the appointment of guardians of minor children in Rogers County District Court. The minor children were both enrolled members of the Cherokee Nation. The district court entered a temporary order appointing Petitioners as Guardians the same day.', '¶3 On June 20, 2013, Cherokee Nation intervened in the case. Nation noted that the minor children are both \"Indian child[ren]\" within the meaning of 25 U.S.C. § 1903(4)1 of ICWA; Indian children\\'s tribe has the absolute right to intervene at any point in a state court proceeding for foster care placement of an Indian child pursuant to 25 U.S.C. § 1911(c)2; Nation\\'s intent at the time was to be involved with ICWA compliance and make recommendations; and Nation reserved the right to transfer the proceedings to tribal court. On October 25, 2013, the district court issued letters of guardianship to Petitioners. On April 11, 2014, the district court filed its order appointing the Petitioners as Guardians.', '¶4 On January 30, 2020, Nation filed a document that it titled \"inactive letter,\" which stated:', '¶5 On November 18, 2021, Nation filed a motion to transfer to Cherokee Nation District Court. Nation first noted that both minor children were members of the Cherokee Nation and came within the definition of \"Indian Child\" within the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA), 25 U.S.C. § 1903(4). Nation also noted that earlier, on September 1, 2020, Nation and the State of Oklahoma had entered the Intergovernmental Agreement Between the State of Oklahoma and the Cherokee Nation Regarding Jurisdiction over Indian Children within the Nation\\'s Reservation. Nation alleged that the State and Nation signed the Agreement in anticipation of a ruling by the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals that the Cherokee Nation Reservation was never disestablished, and that the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals issued such ruling on March 11, 2021, in Hogner v. State, 2021 OK CR 4, 500 P.3d 629. Nation noted that pursuant to ICWA, Nation has exclusive jurisdiction over an \"Indian Child who resides or is domiciled within the reservation of such tribe\" -- but that pursuant to the Agreement, Nation had agreed to concurrent jurisdiction. Nation then pointed to the relevant Agreement language, which stated:', 'Agreement, § V(2). Nation noted that the transfer is not discretionary under the Agreement when requested by the tribe and that the court shall transfer the matter.', '¶6 On December 6, 2021, Guardians filed their response and objection to transfer to Cherokee Nation District Court in which the Guardians denied that the Agreement can be viewed to \"redefine \\'reservation\\' from the definition contained within\" § 1903(10).3 Guardians asserted that the minor children do not reside within Nation\\'s reservation but rather reside at an address in Claremore, Oklahoma, and attached a copy of the deed to Guardians\\' home. Further, Guardians argued that the Agreement cannot usurp federal statutes such as § 1911(b)\\'s provision that a request to transfer from state court to tribal court must be granted unless either parent objects to the transfer or good cause to deny the transfer is demonstrated, which Father had previously done in response to Mother\\'s request for transfer of the proceedings to tribal court.', '¶7 On November 1, 2022, almost a year after Nation filed its motion to transfer, Father also filed an objection and response in opposition to the motion. Father clearly stated his objection was pursuant to § 1911(b). Father argued that the Agreement cannot \"be viewed to redefine \\'reservation\\' from the definition contained within\" § 1903(10). Father also argued that the minor children do not reside within Nation\\'s reservation, but rather live with Guardians in Claremore, Oklahoma.

STANDARD OF REVIEW', '¶10 The State of Oklahoma and the Cherokee Nation entered into the Agreement on September 1, 2020. The Agreement received post hoc endorsement from the Oklahoma Legislature via its amendment of the Oklahoma Indian Child Welfare Act in April of 2021. See 10 O.S.2021, § 40.7; see also 2021 Okla. Sess. Laws 686, 687 (eff. Apr. 23, 2021) (\"The State of Oklahoma hereby ratifies all agreements in conformity with the Federal Indian Child Welfare Act executed prior to the enactment of this act, and any such agreement shall be enforceable in any case filed or pending at the time that an agreement vesting concurrent jurisdiction is entered into between the state and an Indian tribe.\"). Because the Agreement has been ratified via statute by the Oklahoma Legislature, it is public law which must be interpreted by use of canons of statutory construction. See Griffith v. Choctaw Casino of Pocola, 2009 OK 51, ¶ 7, 230 P.3d 488, 491. We review questions of law de novo. In re M.H.C., 2016 OK 88, ¶ 7, 381 P.3d 710, 712.', \"¶11 Both the Agreement and ICWA require the district court to make an initial finding of fact regarding a jurisdictional question -- whether the Indian children live on their tribe's reservation. We have explained the appropriate level of review on jurisdictional questions involving facts as follows:\", 'I. T. K. v. Mounds Pub. Sch., 2019 OK 59, ¶ 11, 451 P.3d 125, 131. This case involves an initial finding of fact by the district court regarding whether the Indian children live on their tribe\\'s reservation; that factual determination is reviewed under a clearly erroneous standard. To reverse \"it must be found that the trial judge made a clearly erroneous conclusion and judgment, against reason and evidence.\" Abel v. Tisdale, 1980 OK 161, ¶ 20, 619 P.2d 608, 612. But we review interpretation of the Agreement and whether it applies to the adjudicated facts de novo as those are questions of law. See In re M.H.C., 2016 OK 88, ¶ 7, 381 P.3d, at 712.', 'III. ANALYSIS', \"¶12 In deciding whether the district court erred in transferring this case to the District Court of the Cherokee Nation pursuant to the Agreement, we must first determine if the Agreement applies here.5 The Agreement only applies to Indian children domiciled within the boundaries of the tribe's reservation. See Agreement, § IV, Concurrent Jurisdiction. If the Indian children are not domiciled within the boundaries of the tribe's reservation, then the Agreement would not apply nor would § 1911(a) of ICWA; in that case, this Court would then review the transfer under the guidelines of § 1911(b).6\", '', 'A. Whether Indian Children Reside on the Cherokee Nation Reservation', '', '¶13 The Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) states a \"\\'reservation\\' means Indian country as defined in section 1151 of Title 187 and any lands, not covered under such section, title to which is either held by the United States in trust for the benefit of any Indian tribe or individual or held by any Indian tribe or individual subject to a restriction by the United States against alienation . . . .\" 25 U.S.C. § 1903(10). This inclusive definition means that in order to be considered a reservation under ICWA the land must be either (1) covered under the definition in § 1151, or (2) held in trust by the United States for the benefit of an Indian tribe or individual, or (3) held by an Indian tribe or individual, subject to a restriction by the United States against alienation. It is clear that the property the Indian children reside on is not under either of the last two categories; thus for the Indian children to live on a reservation under ICWA, they must live in Indian country as defined in § 1151 of the Major Crimes Act. Section 1151 provides:', '18 U.S.C. § 1151. Nation asserts that pursuant to McGirt v. Oklahoma, 591 U.S. 894, 140 S. Ct. 2452, 207 L. Ed. 2d 985 (2020), and Hogner v. State, 2021 OK CR 4, 500 P.3d 629, the Cherokee Nation Reservation still exists under § 1151 and therefore also under ICWA. But Guardians argue the land their home rests on was an Indian allotment, for which the Indian title has been extinguished, thus is not a reservation and the burden is on Nation to prove otherwise.', '¶14 In McGirt, the United States Supreme Court held that the Muscogee Creek Reservation was never disestablished and continues to be Indian Country under the Major Crimes Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1151. McGirt, 591 U.S., at 913, 934--35, 140 S. Ct., at 2468, 2480. The Court clarified there is only one place to look to determine whether a tribe continues to hold a reservation: the Acts of Congress. Id., at 903, 140 S.Ct., at 2462. The McGirt Court also distinguished the allotment process, noting that Congress allotted reservations and also abolished reservations with other tribes such as the Ponca and Otoe, something they did not do with the Muscogee Creek Reservation. See id., at 908, 140 S.Ct., at 2465. McGirt thus expanded the popular understanding of the extent of Indian Country under the Major Crimes Act in Oklahoma, but it did not address the existence or potential disestablishment of the Cherokee Nation Reservation or the existence of any reservation under civil law.', '¶15 As case law has been updated post-McGirt, the United States Supreme Court again addressed the question of jurisdiction in Indian country regarding criminal matters in Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta, 597 U.S. 629, 632--34, 142 S. Ct. 2486, 2492, 213 L. Ed. 2d 847 (June 29, 2022).8 In Castro-Huerta, the United States Supreme Court accepted that the crime occurred in \"Indian country,\" through the Cherokee Reservation, and \"[i]n light of McGirt and the follow-on cases, the eastern part of Oklahoma . . . is now recognized as Indian country.\" Id., 597 U.S., at 632--34, 142 S. Ct., at 2492 (citing State ex rel Matloff v. Wallace, 2021 OK CR 21, ¶ 15, 497 P.3d 686, 689 (reaffirming recognition of the Cherokee Reservation)). While the Supreme Court reversed the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals\\' holding that the state did not have concurrent jurisdiction, it did not disturb in any way the Court of Criminal Appeals\\' prior finding that the Cherokee Nation Reservation was never disestablished and is thus Indian Country for purposes of criminal law. See Castro-Huerta, 597 U.S., at 656, 142 S. Ct., at 2504--05 (holding \"that the Federal Government and the State have concurrent jurisdiction to prosecute crimes committed by non-Indians against Indians in Indian country.\" (emphasis added)).', '¶16 This Court is bound to uphold the United States Supreme Court\\'s holdings in McGirt and Castro-Huerta to the extent that they apply here, if at all.9 The United States Supreme Court recognized the continued existence of the Cherokee Nation Reservation in Castro-Huerta under criminal law. See Castro-Huerta, 597 U.S., at 633--34, 142 S. Ct., at 2491--92. Like the United States Supreme Court, this Court\\'s proper role \"is to declare what the law is, not what we think the law should be.\" Id., at 656, 142 S. Ct., at 2504. \"We will uphold the law of the land whatever it may be.\" In re Initiative Petition No. 349, State Question No. 642, 1992 OK 122, ¶ 14, 838 P.2d, at 7. We thus begin with the United States Supreme Court\\'s recognition that the Cherokee Nation Reservation is Indian Country under criminal law. ICWA\\'s definition of reservation explicitly imports the definition of \"Indian country\" -- as defined by § 1151 of the Major Crimes Act -- thereby incorporating by reference the criminal definition as held in McGirt. Accordingly, the Cherokee Reservation constitutes \"Indian country\" pursuant to § 1151, thereby meeting the definition of reservation under ICWA.', \"¶17 The district court found that the Indian children in question are domiciled on the Cherokee Nation Reservation. Ord. Transferring to Tribal Ct., Jan. 10, 2023. No party submitted any evidence to challenge that recognition by showing that Congress ever explicitly erased or disestablished the boundaries of the Cherokee Nation Reservation. Therefore, the district court was not clearly erroneous in finding the Cherokee Nation Reservation has never been disestablished and the Indian children in this case reside in the Reservation without evidence to support another conclusion. This is a limited holding, applicable only to ICWA. This is not an independent finding. Rather, ICWA's incorporation of § 1151 of the Major Crimes Act in its definition of reservation mandates the outcome of this particular matter.\", 'B. Whether Nation Waived Right to Transfer', '¶18 Guardians argue that Nation has waived its right to transfer through lapse of time. Guardians cite to this Court\\'s recent holding in In re S.J.W., 2023 OK 49, ¶ 18, 535 P.3d 1235, 1244, that \"[b]ecause § 1911\\'s jurisdiction does not concern subject matter jurisdiction, the preservation of it as error is subject to waiver . . . ,\" but Guardians omit the final two words of the clause in the sentence they cited. In full, the sentence in In re S.J.W. reads \"[b]ecause § 1911\\'s jurisdiction does not concern subject matter jurisdiction, the preservation of it as error is subject to waiver on appeal, however; because of its importance, we address the question of whether the Carter County District Court erred in adjudicating S.J.W. deprived.\" Ibid. Unlike In re S.J.W., where the issue of jurisdiction was raised for the first time on appeal, Nation did not fail to present this matter to the district court; rather the determination of the jurisdiction of the Cherokee Nation District Court was a sine qua non to the district court\\'s decision to allow the transfer. Further, § 1911(c) of ICWA allows the child\\'s tribe to intervene at any point in the proceeding. Nation has not through lapse of time waived its right to transfer.', 'C. Whether the Agreement or Section 1911(a) of ICWA Authorize Transfer', '¶19 Guardians argue that aside from the Agreement, transfer of jurisdiction is not warranted by ICWA. Guardians note that § 1911(a) of ICWA provides that tribes have exclusive authority over Indian child custody cases \"except where such jurisdiction is otherwise vested in the State by existing Federal law.\" Guardians assert that the word \"existing\" shows Congress did not intend § 1911(a) of ICWA \"to apply retroactively to cases arising on territory that was not understood at the time of ICWA\\'s enactment to be reservation land, but which was determined to be so only decades later.\" Appellants\\' Br. 18. Guardians argue that while ICWA changed jurisdiction \"by specifying exclusive tribal court jurisdiction over on-reservation child welfare matters and allowing transfer of certain off-reservation matters, it did so only where \\'existing\\' law did not already determine jurisdiction--meaning only where a statute (such as Public Law 280) or common law principles such as res judicata or law of the case did not already govern.\" Id., at 19.', '¶20 We disagree with Guardians\\' interpretation of section 1911(a). Oklahoma is not a Public Law 280 state. See Okla. Tax Comm\\'n v. Citizen Band Potawatomi Indian Tribe of Okla., 498 U.S. 505, 513, 111 S. Ct. 905, 911, 112 L. Ed. 2d 1112 (1991) (recognizing \"Oklahoma disclaimed jurisdiction over Indian lands upon entering the Union and did not reassert jurisdiction over these lands pursuant to Public Law 280.\"); see also Murphy v. Royal, 875 F.3d 896, 936-37 (10th Cir. 2017), aff\\'d sub nom. Sharp v. Murphy, 140 S. Ct. 2412, 207 L. Ed. 2d 1043 (2020). Section 1903(10) of ICWA, defines reservation in part through the Major Crimes Act definition in title 18, § 1151. See infra, ¶ 12. As the McGirt Court noted, if Congress never took action to disestablish a reservation, it continued to exist regardless of the allotment process. Thus, the existing law at the time ICWA was enacted was that a reservation existed, even if the common understanding was that it did not. Without the Agreement, § 1911(a) would mandate transfer to tribal court because under it the tribe has exclusive jurisdiction over Indian children residing on the tribe\\'s reservation.', '¶21 Guardians also argue that even if the Court determines the minor children live on reservation land, the Agreement is not retroactive. But the Agreement includes a retroactivity clause. The retroactivity clause of the Agreement, reads:', \"Agreement, § X, Retroactivity. Guardians assert that this language means that all pending cases are required to continue permanently in state courts. But we disagree with that interpretation. The retroactivity clause of the Agreement applies to all cases currently pending at the time the Agreement became effective. The Agreement further states that cases currently pending in state court would continue so, following the other terms of the Agreement, rather than immediately transferring all pending cases involving Indian children to their tribe. Finally, the retroactivity clause provides that the tribe extends full faith and credit to all child custody determinations rendered in state court prior to the Agreement and the tribe would not petition to invalidate those actions. Nation in this case is not attempting to invalidate the district court's orders or a finalized proceeding. Rather, Nation has simply asked for the case to be transferred to tribal court. At the time of the transfer, Guardians will remain in such position unless and until the tribal court rules otherwise.\", '¶22 Guardians also argue in their brief that section X implicitly assumes that it applies only prospectively because \"Section X\\'s retroactivity provision says that its concurrent jurisdiction provisions--that is, Section IV--will apply to pending cases. The Tribe here is not seeking concurrent jurisdiction but exclusive jurisdiction.\" This is incorrect. Section X actually states: \"Any cases pending in the state courts involving an Indian child domiciled on the Tribe\\'s reservation shall continue in the state courts pursuant to the concurrent jurisdiction described in this Agreement.\" The Agreement thus provides for pending cases to follow the concurrent jurisdiction scheme laid out in the Agreement, not specifically, or only, in the provisions of the concurrent jurisdiction clause itself. Multiple sections in the Agreement discuss concurrent jurisdiction, not only the concurrent jurisdiction clause. The concurrent jurisdiction clause states:', \"The parties have agreed to enter into this jurisdiction sharing Agreement based on the premise that the Tribe has jurisdiction exclusive as to the State over any child custody proceeding involving an Indian child domiciled within the boundaries of the Tribe's reservation as provided for in 25 U.S.C. § 1911(a).\", 'Agreement, § IV, Concurrent Jurisdiction. The concurrent jurisdiction clause therefore allows for the State to have concurrent jurisdiction over Indian children in situations where without the Agreement, the tribe would maintain exclusive jurisdiction over them under ICWA. The concurrent jurisdiction scheme is continued in section V of the Agreement which provides for the tribe to request transfer to tribal court, as Nation has done here, not to re-enact exclusive jurisdiction as if the Agreement never existed.', '¶23 Guardians further argue that under section V of the Agreement, the language explicitly and implicitly repudiates retroactive application, arguing that section V says it applies only to \"initiation of involuntary child custody proceedings\" or \"the party initiating the child custody proceeding.\" But when determining intent of statutory language, the court \"may look at each part of the statute, other statutes on the same subject, and the consequences of any particular interpretation.\" Toch, LLC v. City of Tulsa, 2020 OK 81, ¶ 22, 474 P.3d 859, 866. Regarding determination of tribal or state court jurisdiction, the Agreement states:', \"Agreement, § V, Determination of Tribal or State Court Jurisdiction (emphasis added). While the Agreement lays out the procedures for cases initiated after its enactment and initial determination of jurisdiction, it also provides tribes with the authority to request transfer to tribal court at a later time. Guardians' argument that section V(2) only applies to the party initiating the proceedings completely ignores the latter language in section V(2) which allows the tribe to request transfer to tribal court at any time. We find the Agreement clearly provides for transfer to tribal court in this situation.\", '¶24 Guardians also argue that the Agreement, read in combination with ICWA, actually bars transfer of the case. Guardians believe transfer is barred because ICWA allows tribal-state agreements to \"provide for orderly transfer of jurisdiction on a case-by-case basis.\" See 25 U.S.C. § 1919(a). Guardians assert that the Agreement does not comply with § 1919(a) because the Agreement says the state court shall transfer any involuntary custody proceeding where the State of Oklahoma is not a party if requested by the Tribe. Guardians suggest the \"one-size-fits-all, non-discretionary rule is not an agreement that \\'provide[s]\\' for transfer \\'on a case-by-case basis.\\'\" Again, we disagree. The Agreement provides that the tribe must request transfer on a case-by-case basis when they have otherwise agreed to allow concurrent jurisdiction by the State to continue. That is what Nation has done here; Nation\\'s request to transfer jurisdiction of this proceeding has no effect on other cases pending in state court. The Agreement does exactly what § 1919(a) contemplates.', '¶25 Next, Guardians believe the transfer is barred because (1) § 191410 of ICWA allows tribes to petition courts to invalidate judgments rendered by a state court which should have been rendered by a tribal court and (2) § 1914 is the tribe\\'s sole remedy to reopen past judgments, but the Agreement explicitly waives that authority. Guardians argue that Nation\\'s motion to transfer \"is simply a Section 1914 motion under another name--even though the Tribe has agreed not to file such motions.\" Appellants\\' Br. 20. But Guardians are mistaken in the procedural posture of this case and what is contemplated under § 1914. The matter before us is not a final, past judgment. Nor is Nation requesting invalidation of the guardianship proceedings conducted until this point. This case involves a present, ongoing matter. Nation does not request invalidation of the guardianship, but rather requests transfer of the guardianship to tribal court for further resolution of the matters to commence there. Transfer is clearly authorized by the Agreement and § 1911(a) of ICWA. If we were to somehow find that the Indian children are domiciled within the boundaries of the Cherokee Nation Reservation yet the Agreement did not apply, transfer would be mandatory under § 1911(a) because § 1911(a) provides tribes \"shall have jurisdiction exclusive as to any State over any child custody proceeding involving an Indian child who resides or is domiciled within the reservation of such tribe . . . .\" 25 U.S.C. § 1911.', 'D. Whether Transfer Is Authorized by Section 1911(b) of ICWA', \"¶26 On the other hand, if we were to determine that the Indian children do not reside within the boundaries of the Cherokee Nation Reservation, § 1911(b) would govern the transfer--including its parental objection and good cause provisions. Guardians make several arguments under § 1911(b) that transfer is not authorized. Guardians' entire argument on this point misses the key distinguishing factor in this case, which becomes clear when we read the entirety of § 1911(b):\", \"25 U.S.C. § 1911(b) (emphasis added). The added emphasis to § 1911(b) highlights that in order for § 1911(b) to apply the child must not be domiciled or reside within the reservation of the Indian child's tribe. Above we noted that the district court did not err when it found the Indian children here are domiciled within the Cherokee Nation Reservation.\", \"¶27 The Agreement actually confers more rights upon parents than ICWA itself. Under § 1911(a) of ICWA, the Indian tribe has exclusive jurisdiction over Indian children who reside or are domiciled within the reservation of such tribe. But the Agreement, which applies to those same Indian children who reside or are domiciled within the reservation of the tribe, provides for concurrent jurisdiction except when the tribe requests transfer. The Agreement also provides that if a parent, guardian, or other party, instead of the tribe, requests transfer to tribal court, § 1911(b) will now apply. Without the Agreement, § 1911(b) only applies to Indian children who are not domiciled or residing within the reservation of the Indian child's tribe--thus it would not apply here at all. The district court did not err when it found that the Agreement does not allow the court to consider any parental objections under § 1911(b) of ICWA in order to deny transfer, as the Agreement itself states, because without the Agreement this case would be controlled by the exclusive jurisdiction provision of § 1911(a). The district court did not err in granting Nation's motion to transfer the matter to tribal court.\", 'E. Whether Transfer Violates Due Process', '¶28 Finally, Guardians argue for the first time that transfer here would violate due process of law. Guardians essentially argue that allowing transfer of the case to tribal court would violate the due process rights of the parties to this case, \"all of whom are American citizens entitled to have their rights adjudicated by a process compliant with both the U.S. and Oklahoma Constitutions.\" Appellants\\' Br. While Guardians correctly note that parents have a fundamental right to their children, there is no corresponding fundamental right attributed to Guardians. While Father objected to the transfer of the guardianship to tribal court in the district court proceedings, he failed to appeal the order. Guardians do not have standing to assert a due process claim on Father\\'s behalf. Guardians have shown nothing to make this Court believe that a transfer to Cherokee Nation District Court would violate any of the parties\\' rights to due process.', 'IV. CONCLUSION', \"¶29 We find that the district court was not clearly erroneous in finding that the Indian children in this case are domiciled in the Cherokee Nation Reservation. We do not find that the Cherokee Nation Reservation has never been disestablished without any restrictions attached or for purposes of civil law generally. Rather, this holding is merely an acknowledgment of the existence of the Cherokee Nation Reservation under ICWA due to ICWA's incorporation of § 1151 of the Major Crimes Act in the ICWA definition of Indian country. We find the district court did not err in granting Nation's motion to transfer. The district court is affirmed.

The term \"reservation\" remained nonexistent in our lexicon until 2020.', \"¶2 In 2020, the United States Supreme Court handed down McGirt v. Oklahoma, 591 U.S. 894 (2020) where for the first time in history the Court recognized reservation status of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation--but limited its finding to the Major Crimes Act. Two years later in Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta, 597 U.S. 629 (2022), the United States Supreme Court acquiesced the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals's finding that the eastern part of Oklahoma is now recognized as Indian country (including the Cherokee Nation).

I write separately to explain why this Court must address the implications of McGirt v. Oklahoma, 591 U.S. 894 (2020), on child custody proceedings governed by ICWA.\", '¶2 In its recitation of the applicable standard of review on appeal, the majority opinion correctly states that \"[b]oth the Agreement and ICWA require the district court to make an initial finding of fact regarding a jurisdictional question -- whether the Indian children live on their tribe\\'s reservation.\" Majority Op. ¶ 11. Said another way, we cannot escape deciding whether the Indian children live on land within the \"reservation\" or \"Indian country.\" That\\'s true regardless of whether we proceed under the Agreement or under ICWA, as illustrated below.', '¶3 Under ICWA, we must look to § 1911 to determine whether jurisdiction lies in the state court or tribal court. Subsection (a) gives the tribe exclusive jurisdiction if the Indian children \"reside[] or [are] domiciled within the reservation of such tribe.\" 25 U.S.C. § 1911(a) (2018); see also Wilburn v. State (In re S.J.W.), 2023 OK 49, ¶ 20, 535 P.3d 1235, 1245. Subsection (b) gives the tribe and the State of Oklahoma concurrent jurisdiction over \"Indian child[ren] not domiciled or residing within the reservation of the Indian child\\'s tribe,\" with an understanding that the State court \"in the absence of good cause to the contrary, shall transfer such proceeding to the jurisdiction of the tribe, absent objection by either parent, upon the petition of either parent or the Indian custodian or the Indian child\\'s tribe.\" § 1911(b); see also Wilburn, 2023 OK 49, ¶ 20, 535 P.3d at 1245. Thus, which subsection of § 1911 governs depends upon whether the children are or are not residing on the \"reservation.\" Insofar as § 1903(10) of ICWA defines \"reservation\" to mean \"Indian country as defined in section 1151 of Title 18,\" we must look to McGirt for a definition of the term \"Indian country\" as used in 18 U.S.C. § 1151. That is, we must determine what is meant by \"reservation\" in a post-McGirt world. See Majority Op. ¶ 16.', '¶4 If we use the Agreement instead, we can\\'t escape assessing whether the children reside within the reservation--contrary to what some of the other separate writings in this case would suggest. The Agreement aims to \"create concurrent jurisdiction on the reservation of the Cherokee Nation with the State of Oklahoma\" in lands that were not considered part of the reservation until after McGirt, although it never explicitly mentions that case. See Intergovernmental Agreement Regarding Jurisdiction over Indian Children Within the Nation\\'s Reservation, State of Okla.-Cherokee Nation, Sept. 1, 2020, Okla. Sec\\'y of State Doc. No. 50566, § I, at 1 (emphasis added), available at https://www.sos.ok.gov/documents/filelog/ 93672.pdf. How do we know that was the intent? The Agreement never explicitly defines \"reservation\" in the \"DEFINED TERMS\" in Section (II). But the Agreement does discuss the \"reservation\" through comparison to and contrast with other lands. For example, Section (IV) spells out when the Cherokee Nation intends to share concurrent jurisdiction with the State of Oklahoma:', '(A) all Indian allotments, the Indian titles to which have not been extinguished, including rights-of-way running through the same;', 'or', 'Intergovernmental Agreement, supra, § IV, at 2--3 (emphasis added). From this language we glean a few things. First, \"the Agreements only contemplate concurrent jurisdiction in the event [§] 1911(a) applies,\" Wilburn, 2023 OK 49, ¶ 19, 535 P.3d at 1245 (emphasis added), which in turn depends upon whether the children \"reside[] or [are] domiciled within the reservation,\" 25 U.S.C. § 1911(a).1 Second, the exceptions in Section (IV)(1) describe lands that were collectively--albeit incorrectly--considered \"Indian country\" prior to McGirt. For instance, the exception in Section (IV)(1)(B) sounds much like the language in § 1903(10) of ICWA that defines \"reservation\" to include \"any lands . . . title to which is either held by the United States in trust for the benefit of any Indian tribe or individual or held by any Indian tribe or individual subject to a restriction by the United States against alienation.\" 25 U.S.C. § 1903(10) (2018). And the exception in Section (IV)(1)(A) resembles the language in § 1151(c) of the Major Crimes Act (referenced in § 1903(10) of ICWA) that defines \"Indian country\" to include \"all Indian allotments, the Indian titles to which have not been extinguished, including rights-of-way running through the same.\" 18 U.S.C. § 1151(c) (2018). These similarities demonstrate the intent of the parties to the Agreement to maintain exclusive jurisdiction where it existed prior to McGirt. Moving along to Section (V)(1), the Agreement lays out certain \"procedures [that] will apply to initiation of involuntary child custody proceedings in an Oklahoma court regarding an Indian child who is domiciled or resident on the Tribe\\'s reservation, but not domiciled on the lands described above in Section (IV)(1).\" Intergovernmental Agreement, supra, § V, at 3 (emphasis added). In other words, the terms of the agreement only apply to an Indian child who resides on McGirt\\'s expanded reservation, but not on pre-McGirt Indian country. In Section (V)(2), we finally arrive at the provision that governs this matter: \"In guardianships, adoptions, or other child custody proceedings where the State of Oklahoma is not a party and the child is domiciled or located within the reservation of the Tribe, the party initiating the child custody proceeding may file said action in either the state or the relevant tribal court,\" id. § V(2), at 4 (emphasis added), with the understanding that \"[t]he state court shall transfer any voluntary custody proceeding, or any involuntary custody proceeding where the State of Oklahoma is not a party, to the tribal court if requested by the tribe,\" id. (emphasis added). Each of these provisions of the Agreement requires us to analyze whether the children are or are not residing on the reservation as expanded by McGirt.', \"¶5 Consequently, the children's residency upon the reservation--and McGirt's implications on that determination--are issues we must address whether we proceed under the statute or the Agreement.\", '¶6 Because the children reside on land in Claremore that is within the Cherokee Nation\\'s historical reservation boundaries as understood after McGirt, see Majority Op. ¶ 17, the tribal court had exclusive jurisdiction under § 1911(a) of ICWA but for the Agreement, see id. ¶ 20. Under the Agreement, the State\\'s district court had concurrent jurisdiction pursuant to Section (IV) of the Agreement until the Cherokee Nation asked for a transfer of this guardianship proceeding to tribal court pursuant to Section (V)(2) of the Agreement. Id. ¶ 23. At that point, the \"shall transfer\" language of Section (V)(2) required the state court to transfer the matter to the tribal court. Moreover, Section (V)(2) provides that \"[t]he good cause provisions of 25 U.S.C. § 1911(b) and the accompanying regulations shall not operate to deny transfer to tribal court as the tribal court would have otherwise had exclusive jurisdiction\" under § 1911(a) of ICWA. Intergovernmental Agreement, supra, § (V)(2), at 4; see also Majority Op. ¶ 27. Thus, there was no basis for the state court to refuse transfer to the tribal court.', \"¶7 Consequently, we must affirm the district court's order transferring this matter to tribal court.\", 'FOOTNOTES', \"1 This precedential statement definitively demonstrates that the majority's discussion about whether § 1911(a) or (b) authorizes transfer is not dicta, contrary to what Justice Kane asserts in his separate writing. See Kane, J., Concurring ¶ 2. Because § 1911(a) does apply, the Agreement applies.\", '', '', 'KANE, J., concurring:', '¶1 I concur with the Court\\'s holding that the trial court did not err in transferring the matter to the tribal court pursuant to the terms of the Agreement. I concur that Congress\\'s definition of \"reservation,\" for purposes of the Indian Child Welfare Act, includes \"Indian country as defined in section 1151 of Title 18 . . . .\" 25 U.S.C. § 1903(10). Congress explicitly and fully adopted the Major Crimes Act\\'s definition of \"Indian country\" for ICWA.1 I further concur that the Court\\'s holding the Indian children in this case reside within the boundaries of the Cherokee Reservation is limited to the definitions of \"reservation\" and \"Indian country\" in ICWA and the Major Crimes Act, respectively.', \"¶2 I write separately to say that, because the Agreement governs this child custody proceeding, the Court's discussion of whether transfer is authorized under 25 U.S.C. § 1911(a) and (b) is dicta. It is not essential to the disposition of this case. Pursuant to 25 U.S.C. § 1919, the State and the Cherokee Nation agreed to share concurrent jurisdiction over these Indian children domiciled within the Cherokee Reservation. Because the Agreement applies, § 1911(a) doesn't apply. Likewise, because the Agreement applies, § 1911(b) doesn't apply.2 Subsection (b) would govern transfer if the Indian children did not reside on the Cherokee Reservation, in which case the Agreement would not apply. Here, the State and the Cherokee Nation have agreed to transfer this case according to the terms of the Agreement. See Agreement, § V(2).\", 'FOOTNOTES', '1 Similarly, Congress adopted the Major Crimes Act\\'s definition in 18 U.S.C. § 2265(e), which provides that state and tribal courts have concurrent jurisdiction to issue and enforce civil protection orders \"in the Indian country of the Indian tribe (as defined in Section 1151) . . . .\" 18 U.S.C. § 2265(e) (emphasis added); see Milne v. Hudson, 2022 OK 84, ¶¶ 11-16, 519 P.3d 511, 513-515 (applying the Major Crimes Act\\'s definition under 18 U.S.C. § 2265(e)).', '2 According to the Agreement, when an Indian child resides on the reservation and the Agreement governs a voluntary child custody proceeding or involuntary child custody proceeding where the State is not involved, the good cause provisions of 25 U.S.C. § 1911(b) apply if a parent, guardian, or other party (not the Tribe) requests transfer to the tribal court. See Agreement, § V(2). That is not what we have here. Here, the Cherokee Nation requested transfer to the tribal court.', '', '', 'KUEHN, V.C.J., CONCURRING IN RESULT:', \"¶1 I agree with the Majority that the District Court correctly transferred this case to the District Court of the Cherokee Nation pursuant to the Intergovernmental Agreement between the two.1 I write separately to emphasize that none of the Father's and Guardians' objections to the trial court's decision are relevant here, whether based on case law or statute. Additionally, I emphasize that the Majority incorrectly and unnecessarily decides to determine reservation status here. I believe the question of reservation status was settled by McGirt and subsequent cases considering the reservation status of tribes with similar treaties. McGirt v. Oklahoma, 140 S.Ct. 2452, 2460-62, 2464, 2468 (2020). This Court should not attempt to redefine reservation status or Indian Country in every separate civil case. Furthermore I conclude, as did the District Court, that the four corners of the Agreement apply and govern this matter, negating any court determination of reservation status in ICWA cases.\", \"¶2 The State and Nation entered into the Agreement on September 1, 2020, and the Oklahoma Legislature ratified it by amendment of the Oklahoma ICWA in April 2021. 10 O.S. § 40.7; 2021 Okla. Sess. Laws 686, 687 (eff. Apr. 23, 2021). Because the Legislature ratified the Agreement, it is a public law, comparable to statute, and we review the District Court's decision de novo. Griffith v. Choctaw Casino of Pocola, 2009 OK 51, ¶ 7, 230 P.3d 488, 491.\", \"¶3 The Agreement's preamble explicitly notes that it is intended to memorialize a partnership between the State and the Nation, to streamline the jurisdictional provisions of ICWA, and create concurrent jurisdiction for the Nation and the State on cases arising on the Cherokee Reservation. The relevant section of ICWA provides:\", '25 U.S.C. § 1919(a). Before September 1, 2020, the State and the Nation did not need an agreement since the reservation was not popularly recognized. State district courts regularly exercised jurisdiction in ICWA cases; with the Nation participating in state courts, it was thought the Cherokee children involved were not domiciled within a reservation. 25 U.S.C. § 1911(b). It was not until the United States Supreme Court ruling in McGirt v. Oklahoma, 591 U.S. 894 (2020), in July 2020 that the State and the Nation negotiated and agreed upon the terms of the Agreement. These parties established the environment in Oklahoma for which deprived Indian child cases under ICWA would proceed and under what reservation status.', \"¶4 Under the Agreement, Section 1911(a) would now apply in cases where, as here, the Cherokee child was domiciled within its tribal reservation, and the Nation's courts would have exclusive jurisdiction. 25 U.S.C. § 1911(a). In Section IV of the Agreement, the State agreed that, without the Agreement's provisions for concurrent jurisdiction, the Nation would have exclusive jurisdiction over its children domiciled within Reservation boundaries under Section 1911(a). The Nation agreed to relinquish exclusive jurisdiction and, in some circumstances, share the jurisdictional burden with state courts, reserving in each case the right to transfer the matter to tribal court. This served to advance the interests of both the State and the Nation and give effect to the ICWA requirements and policies surrounding the separation of Indian children from their families and tribes. The Agreement had the practical effect of restoring the concurrent jurisdiction common before McGirt. This does not suggest that the McGirt holding itself applies to this or any other civil matter. This Agreement is limited to its terms and affects only the parties to the Agreement.\", \"¶5 Notably, the Agreement nowhere attempts to define or delimit the Reservation's boundaries. Instead, the parties explicitly agree that for implementing ICWA, the Cherokee Reservation has already been established and exists. Further, Section X of the Agreement specifically provides that its provision for concurrent jurisdiction applies retroactively to any pending cases, actions, or proceedings as of the Agreement's effective date.\", '¶6 In this case, Guardians claim that Children do not reside on the Reservation and ask this Court to determine that transfer to the Cherokee Nation District Court violates provisions of ICWA. The Majority suggests that to do so, this Court must determine whether the Reservation was disestablished and what its boundaries are. I disagree. For ICWA purposes, the Agreement itself answers this question: Children, enrolled members of the Cherokee Nation, lived with Guardians in Claremore, which is the undisputed physical address that sits squarely within the larger geographical boundaries of the Reservation after the Agreement was signed.2', \"¶7 I would find that the Agreement applies here as a matter of law. And, given its status as public law in Oklahoma, plus the authorizing provision of Section 1919(a), I would reject Guardians' arguments that ICWA Section 1911(a), not the Agreement, controls here. I note that, were Guardians correct that Section 1911(a) controlled over the Agreement, the District Court's decision to transfer the case would still be correct -- in that circumstance, since Children reside on the Reservation, the Nation would have exclusive jurisdiction. And Guardians' argument that ICWA Section 1911(b) prevents the transfer fails because that statute applies only where children do not live within reservation boundaries.\", \"¶8 The Agreement compelled the District Court's decision to transfer the case upon Nation's request. The Agreement provides that, in guardianships where the State is not a party and the children are located on the Reservation, the party initiating the proceedings may file in either state or tribal court; that court will retain exclusive, continuing jurisdiction unless the Nation moves to transfer the case to tribal court. At that point the State shall transfer the proceeding. Here, the Nation monitored the case for several years, then, after the Agreement was established, asked that it be transferred. The record does not support Guardians' suggestion that the Nation waived the right to request a transfer through lapse of time. This Court has suggested that a claim of error under Section 1911 is subject to waiver on appeal. In the Matter of S.J.W., 2023 OK 49, ¶ 18, 535 P.3d 1235, 1244. Nation has been involved in the proceedings below almost since their commencement and has not delayed the process in either its transfer request or this subsequent appeal.\", \"¶9 I agree that the transfer required by the Agreement does not violate Guardians' due process rights. Guardians do not have the same fundamental right to Children that parents do. Father did not appeal the order transferring the case, and Guardians cannot raise a due process claim for him. Furthermore, the Agreement compelled the order to transfer the case from Rogers County to the Cherokee Nation District Court -- but neither the Agreement nor the transfer order removed Guardians from their position nor required them to relocate with Children. I agree that the stay should be lifted and the case transferred to the Cherokee Nation District Court.\", 'FOOTNOTES', \"1 The transfer is based on the Intergovernmental Agreement Between the State of Oklahoma and the Cherokee Nation Regarding Jurisdiction over Indian Children Within the Nation's Reservation (Agreement).

That month, the Cherokee Nation first intervened in the case, pursuant to the provisions of the federal Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) 25 U.S.C. § 1911(c), to preserve Nation's interest in the placement of Children; the case remained in state court in Rogers County. Nothing is unusual about this process; as explained previously, the State and Nation had concurrent jurisdiction before the Agreement was necessary. Guardians were formally appointed in April 2014. In January 2020, the Nation filed a document noting that it intended to move to inactive status in the case, but wished to be notified of new hearings and reserved the possibility of renewing its involvement. Subsequently, the Nation filed a motion to transfer the case to the Cherokee Nation District Court on November 18, 2021. After a hearing, on January 10, 2023, the district court granted the motion to transfer but stayed the execution of the order pending any appeal.\", '', '', 'EMAIL: webmaster@oscn.net\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tOklahoma Judicial Center\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t2100 N Lincoln Blvd.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tOklahoma City, OK 73105']\n"

The Supreme Court held that the issuance of a subpoena duces tecum is not among the methods prescribed by the Oklahoma Discovery Code by which an expert witness's financial information may be discovered. The Court noted that the Discovery Code permits a party to discover an expert's compensation in the instant case, as well as a list of any other cases the expert has testified for in the past four years. However, the Code does not require the expert to produce documentation on how much they were paid in those cases.

Fryar had submitted an affidavit on December 10, 2024, requesting to resign her membership in the OBA and relinquish her right to practice law pending disciplinary proceedings. The Supreme Court granted the application, accepted Fryar's resignation, and ordered that her name be stricken from the Roll of Attorneys. Fryar is prohibited from applying for reinstatement to the OBA prior to the expiration of five years from the effective date of the order. Fryar must also comply with Rule 9.1 of the Rules Governing Disciplinary Proceedings.\n",
